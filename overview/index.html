    <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-in-this-module">What is in this module</h2>
<p>This module does not contain all the information that is required to play the Star Citizen Module of Starfinder. I highly encourage you to go and purchase the original core-rulebook from <a href="https://paizo.com/starfinder">Paizo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-different-in-the-starfinder-citizen-module">What is different in the Starfinder Citizen module</h2>
<p>Starfinder is a sci-fi take on the original Pathfinder high fantasy tabletop rpg. As such Starfinder includes a lot of fantasy elements into the the system. While you could opt to use it, Star Citizen is a high tech level/0 magic level campain settings. As such All skills, feats, classes, and rules regarding magic will not apply and will not be included in this module and setting. </p>
<p>However I would like to point a few things we're adding to help with your Star Citizen Immersion. First while Starfinder has a lot of rules for Combat we will be: 
1. Adding rules and tables for Mining and Salvaging.
2. Adding damage and healing system more similar to Star Citizen
3. Adding in Death of a Spaceman Rules
4. Adding Star Citizen Lore specific factions
5. Creating a library of In-Game and Concept Ships and weapons so you can pilot the ship of your dreams even if it's not out Flight Ready yet.</p>
<p>Another key factor goal of this project is to expand beyond the basic rules of Starfinder, mostly a well balanced space opera and move it more into a Sandbox style game. While you may have a GM that is well prepared with adventures for you, a lot of the fun of Star Citizen is the emergent gameplay. This is the type of feel and adventure that we want to grow here, </p>
<p><strong>Great Emergent Stories. 
<br>The emergent stories created in a sandbox game are different. The GM does not have a single prearranged story on hand that he expects to fit the players into; he has many potential stories, for many potential places, all of them locales that the players may or may not visit. He might have a general idea of the goals that the players wish to accomplish, or offer them particular plot hooks to catch their interest and focus their efforts, but he largely sits back and facilitates the stories that the players grow themselves.
<br>Luckily we already have fleshed out systems, planets, stations and factiosn for you to move around in and we will be providing you with the the tools that you will need for quick generation tools for plot hooks, places of interest, and adventure frameworks ready for elaboration.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>Once you have your hands on the core-rulebook you may want to dive directly into the rules and character creation beginning in Chapter 2, or you may want to dig into the Star Citizen Lore, some of which will contained in this module while the rest can be found at <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/">Roberts Space Industries</a>.</p>
<p>For players Making Characters, <strong>Chapter 2</strong> of the Core-Rulebook will provide you a step-by-step walk-through of the process that includes references to the relevant chapters. However, different from the rulebook rather than viewing <strong>Chapter 3</strong> with information about the different core races, please use the descriptions under that <strong>Races Tab</strong> in this module.</p>
<h2 id="basic-starfinder-concepts">Basic Starfinder Concepts</h2>
<h3 id="1d6-d20-etc">1d6, d20, etc.</h3>
<p>These figures are abbreviations for die rolls and indicate which dice you roll to determine a variable number, such as the amount of damage a weapon deals. The first number tells you how many dice to roll, while the second number tells you the number of sides the die or dice must have; if there’s no first number, just
roll one die. For example, “roll 2d8” means that you must roll two eight-sided dice, and “roll a d20” means you must roll one 20-sided die. Occasionally, you may need to roll a d3; if you don’t have a three-sided die, you can roll a d6 instead—treat a roll of 1 or 2 as a 1, a roll of 3 or 4 as a 2, and a roll of 5 or 6 as a 3.</p>
<h3 id="abbreviations">Abbreviations</h3>
<p>Starfinder has many game terms that are typically expressed as abbreviations, including HP (Hit Points), SP (Stamina Points), and RP (Resolve Points). If you miss or forget what an abbreviation means, they’re explained in the glossary starting on page 512 (of the core-rulebook).
Armor Class (AC) This is a number representing how hard it is for an enemy to strike your character in combat. A character has two Armor Classes: Energy Armor Class (EAC) and Kinetic Armor Class (KAC).</p>
<h3 id="attack-roll">Attack Roll</h3>
<p>An attack roll is a d20 roll that represents your character’s attempt to strike another creature in combat. Check A check is a d20 roll that may or may not be modified by your character’s statistics or another value. The most common types are skill checks and ability checks (which determine whether you successfully perform a task), and initiative checks (which determine when you act in combat). Combat Typically, references to combat refer to tactical combat between individual characters, which takes place on a square-gridded battle map and is covered in depth in Chapter 8. Combat can instead refer to starship combat, which uses a hex map; you can find the details of that system in Chapter 9. </p>
<h3 id="creature">Creature</h3>
<p>A creature is an active participant in the story or world. This includes player characters (PCs), nonplayer characters (NPCs), and monsters. </p>
<h3 id="difficulty-class-dc">Difficulty Class (DC)</h3>
<p>This is the target number a creature must meet or exceed when attempting a check in order to accomplish a given task.</p>
<h3 id="encounter">Encounter</h3>
<p>An encounter is a situation that presents characters with a challenge. This could be a roleplaying challenge where they need to get information, a physical battle, a trap or puzzle, or anything else that requires players to use their wits or their characters’ statistics. Characters typically earn experience
points for completing encounters.</p>
<h3 id="experience-points-xp">Experience Points (XP)</h3>
<p>Often just called “experience,” this is a way of tracking your character’s increasing expertise gained as a result of overcoming challenges. When characters earn enough experience points, they advance in level, or “level up” (see Leveling Up on page 26).</p>
<h3 id="game-master-gm">Game Master (GM)</h3>
<p>The Game Master is the player who adjudicates the rules and controls the various elements of the Starfinder story and world that the players explore. A GM’s duty is to provide a fair and fun game—she wants the other players to ultimately succeed in their goals, but only after much heroic striving and danger.</p>
<h3 id="hit-points-hp-and-stamina-points-sp">Hit Points (HP) and Stamina Points (SP)</h3>
<p>Stamina Points represent how much damage you can take before you’re actually hurt, while Hit Points represent how badly hurt you can be before you fall unconscious or die. Stamina Points are lost before Hit Points and are much easier to regain. For a more detailed explanation, see page 22.</p>
<h3 id="level">Level</h3>
<p>A level is an indication of relative power within the game. There are several types of levels. Class level is the number of levels of a specific class that a character has. Character level is the sum of all of the levels a character has in all of her classes. Level can
also refer to an item’s level, or another scaling mechanic that falls within the framework of the game’s rules.</p>
<h3 id="modifier">Modifier</h3>
<p>A modifier is a number that is added to a roll such as an attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. It can be positive or negative.</p>
<h3 id="monster">Monster</h3>
<p>A monster is a nonplayer character. In general, monsters are too strange or unintelligent to be player characters, or are prevented from being them for other reasons. A monster might be a player character’s opponent or ally, or serve any other role.</p>
<h3 id="nonplayer-character-npc">Nonplayer Character (NPC)</h3>
<p>A nonplayer character is controlled by the GM for the purpose of interacting with players and helping advance the story.</p>
<h3 id="player-character-pc">Player Character (PC)</h3>
<p>This is a character controlled by a player.</p>
<h3 id="roleplaying">Roleplaying</h3>
<p>Describing a character’s actions, often while play-acting from the perspective of the character, is referred to as roleplaying. When a player speaks or describes action from the perspective of a character, it is referred to as being “in character.”</p>
<h3 id="round">Round</h3>
<p>In tactical combat, a round is a unit of time equal to 6 seconds in the game world; every character who is able to act gets a turn once per round. In starship combat, rounds consist of three phases of actions and don’t correlate to a specific amount of time. </p>
<h3 id="saving-throw">Saving Throw</h3>
<p>A saving throw is a d20 roll representing your character’s attempt to avoid or reduce some harmful effect.</p>
<h3 id="tier">Tier</h3>
<p>Tier indicates scaling and is similar in meaning to “level”; it is used for computers and starships, as well as other elements.</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-play">Overview of Play</h2>
<p>Building a basic understanding of Starfinder gameplay will help you absorb the game’s mechanical details. The following are common aspects of Starfinder play.</p>
<h3 id="roleplaying_1">Roleplaying</h3>
<p>Anytime you’re speaking for your character or describing her actions but aren’t in combat, you’re roleplaying. This could be haggling with a trader, describing your plan to sneak into a research station,
or just having a conversation with another player “in character.” These situations often require skill checks, in which a player rolls a 20-sided die and adds her modifier from the appropriate skill (see
Chapter 5 for more about skills), special abilities. Sometimes roleplaying may progress into tactical combat. Game Masters should encourage players to be
creative and resourceful during roleplaying, while also ensuring that their actions have consequences—don’t insult an excitable crime boss unless you’re ready to defend yourself!</p>
<h3 id="exploring">Exploring</h3>
<p>Starfinder is primarily a space opera, and exploring and
experiencing new worlds are key parts of the game. Exploration in Starfinder might involve a single space station, a new and alien planet, a faraway solar system, or the vast reaches of space. It might involve any aspect of roleplaying, but it always involves
the GM describing the new and exciting scenes the PCs uncover and with which they can interact. Cultures, environments, and other wonders and hazards vary wildly when PCs explore new places. The setting material found in this module  can help GMs describe the places the PCs venture, and the rules in Chapter 11 of the core-rulebook explain how to adjudicate the PCs’ adventures in strange and hazardous places with regard to their statistics and abilities.</p>
<h3 id="tactical-combat">Tactical Combat</h3>
<p>When the PCs confront or are accosted by a creature or character, the game shifts to tactical combat. Tactical combat involves characters moving around a tactical battle map, attacking  or other special abilities, and defending themselves from their enemies. In Starfinder, attacking generally involves rolling a 20-sided die, adding modifiers to the result, and comparing the total to enemy statistics such as Armor Class to determine whether a target is hit. When their attacks hit, characters deal a variable amount of damage depending on their weapons and statistics. But of course, the enemy can do the same thing to them! Full details about Starfinder’s tactical rules can be found in Chapter 8 of the core-rulebook.</p>
<h3 id="starship-combat">Starship Combat</h3>
<p>In combat between starships, the PCs pilot their ship around a starship battle map, trying to maneuver into the best position to fire on their enemies without being hit themselves. Full details about Starfinder’s starship combat rules can be found in Chapter 9.</p>
