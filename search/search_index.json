I highly encourage you to go and purchase the original core-rulebook from Paizo . What is different in the Starfinder Citizen module Starfinder is a sci-fi take on the original Pathfinder high fantasy tabletop rpg. As such Starfinder includes a lot of fantasy elements into the the system. While you could opt to use it, Star Citizen is a high tech level/0 magic level campain settings. As such All skills, feats, classes, and rules regarding magic will not apply and will not be included in this module and setting. However I would like to point a few things we're adding to help with your Star Citizen Immersion. First while Starfinder has a lot of rules for Combat we will be: 1. Adding rules and tables for Mining and Salvaging. 2. Adding damage and healing system more similar to Star Citizen 3. Adding in Death of a Spaceman Rules 4. Adding Star Citizen Lore specific factions 5. Creating a library of In-Game and Concept Ships and weapons so you can pilot the ship of your dreams even if it's not out Flight Ready yet. Another key factor goal of this project is to expand beyond the basic rules of Starfinder, mostly a well balanced space opera and move it more into a Sandbox style game. While you may have a GM that is well prepared with adventures for you, a lot of the fun of Star Citizen is the emergent gameplay. This is the type of feel and adventure that we want to grow here, Great Emergent Stories. The emergent stories created in a sandbox game are different. The GM does not have a single prearranged story on hand that he expects to fit the players into; he has many potential stories, for many potential places, all of them locales that the players may or may not visit. He might have a general idea of the goals that the players wish to accomplish, or offer them particular plot hooks to catch their interest and focus their efforts, but he largely sits back and facilitates the stories that the players grow themselves. Luckily we already have fleshed out systems, planets, stations and factiosn for you to move around in and we will be providing you with the the tools that you will need for quick generation tools for plot hooks, places of interest, and adventure frameworks ready for elaboration. Getting Started Once you have your hands on the core-rulebook you may want to dive directly into the rules and character creation beginning in Chapter 2, or you may want to dig into the Star Citizen Lore, some of which will contained in this module while the rest can be found at Roberts Space Industries . For players Making Characters, Chapter 2 of the Core-Rulebook will provide you a step-by-step walk-through of the process that includes references to the relevant chapters. However, different from the rulebook rather than viewing Chapter 3 with information about the different core races, please use the descriptions under that Races Tab in this module. Basic Starfinder Concepts 1d6, d20, etc. These figures are abbreviations for die rolls and indicate which dice you roll to determine a variable number, such as the amount of damage a weapon deals. The first number tells you how many dice to roll, while the second number tells you the number of sides the die or dice must have; if there\u2019s no first number, just roll one die. For example, \u201croll 2d8\u201d means that you must roll two eight-sided dice, and \u201croll a d20\u201d means you must roll one 20-sided die. Occasionally, you may need to roll a d3; if you don\u2019t have a three-sided die, you can roll a d6 instead\u2014treat a roll of 1 or 2 as a 1, a roll of 3 or 4 as a 2, and a roll of 5 or 6 as a 3. Abbreviations Starfinder has many game terms that are typically expressed as abbreviations, including HP (Hit Points), SP (Stamina Points), and RP (Resolve Points). If you miss or forget what an abbreviation means, they\u2019re explained in the glossary starting on page 512 (of the core-rulebook). Armor Class (AC) This is a number representing how hard it is for an enemy to strike your character in combat. A character has two Armor Classes: Energy Armor Class (EAC) and Kinetic Armor Class (KAC). Attack Roll An attack roll is a d20 roll that represents your character\u2019s attempt to strike another creature in combat. Check A check is a d20 roll that may or may not be modified by your character\u2019s statistics or another value. The most common types are skill checks and ability checks (which determine whether you successfully perform a task), and initiative checks (which determine when you act in combat). Combat Typically, references to combat refer to tactical combat between individual characters, which takes place on a square-gridded battle map and is covered in depth in Chapter 8. Combat can instead refer to starship combat, which uses a hex map; you can find the details of that system in Chapter 9. Creature A creature is an active participant in the story or world. This includes player characters (PCs), nonplayer characters (NPCs), and monsters. Difficulty Class (DC) This is the target number a creature must meet or exceed when attempting a check in order to accomplish a given task. Encounter An encounter is a situation that presents characters with a challenge. This could be a roleplaying challenge where they need to get information, a physical battle, a trap or puzzle, or anything else that requires players to use their wits or their characters\u2019 statistics. Characters typically earn experience points for completing encounters. Experience Points (XP) Often just called \u201cexperience,\u201d this is a way of tracking your character\u2019s increasing expertise gained as a result of overcoming challenges. When characters earn enough experience points, they advance in level, or \u201clevel up\u201d (see Leveling Up on page 26). Game Master (GM) The Game Master is the player who adjudicates the rules and controls the various elements of the Starfinder story and world that the players explore. A GM\u2019s duty is to provide a fair and fun game\u2014she wants the other players to ultimately succeed in their goals, but only after much heroic striving and danger. Hit Points (HP) and Stamina Points (SP) Stamina Points represent how much damage you can take before you\u2019re actually hurt, while Hit Points represent how badly hurt you can be before you fall unconscious or die. Stamina Points are lost before Hit Points and are much easier to regain. For a more detailed explanation, see page 22. Level A level is an indication of relative power within the game. There are several types of levels. Class level is the number of levels of a specific class that a character has. Character level is the sum of all of the levels a character has in all of her classes. Level can also refer to an item\u2019s level, or another scaling mechanic that falls within the framework of the game\u2019s rules. Modifier A modifier is a number that is added to a roll such as an attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. It can be positive or negative. Monster A monster is a nonplayer character. In general, monsters are too strange or unintelligent to be player characters, or are prevented from being them for other reasons. A monster might be a player character\u2019s opponent or ally, or serve any other role. Nonplayer Character (NPC) A nonplayer character is controlled by the GM for the purpose of interacting with players and helping advance the story. Player Character (PC) This is a character controlled by a player. Roleplaying Describing a character\u2019s actions, often while play-acting from the perspective of the character, is referred to as roleplaying. When a player speaks or describes action from the perspective of a character, it is referred to as being \u201cin character.\u201d Round In tactical combat, a round is a unit of time equal to 6 seconds in the game world; every character who is able to act gets a turn once per round. In starship combat, rounds consist of three phases of actions and don\u2019t correlate to a specific amount of time. Saving Throw A saving throw is a d20 roll representing your character\u2019s attempt to avoid or reduce some harmful effect. Tier Tier indicates scaling and is similar in meaning to \u201clevel\u201d; it is used for computers and starships, as well as other elements. Overview of Play Building a basic understanding of Starfinder gameplay will help you absorb the game\u2019s mechanical details. The following are common aspects of Starfinder play. Roleplaying Anytime you\u2019re speaking for your character or describing her actions but aren\u2019t in combat, you\u2019re roleplaying. This could be haggling with a trader, describing your plan to sneak into a research station, or just having a conversation with another player \u201cin character.\u201d These situations often require skill checks, in which a player rolls a 20-sided die and adds her modifier from the appropriate skill (see Chapter 5 for more about skills), special abilities. Sometimes roleplaying may progress into tactical combat. Game Masters should encourage players to be creative and resourceful during roleplaying, while also ensuring that their actions have consequences\u2014don\u2019t insult an excitable crime boss unless you\u2019re ready to defend yourself! Exploring Starfinder is primarily a space opera, and exploring and experiencing new worlds are key parts of the game. Exploration in Starfinder might involve a single space station, a new and alien planet, a faraway solar system, or the vast reaches of space. It might involve any aspect of roleplaying, but it always involves the GM describing the new and exciting scenes the PCs uncover and with which they can interact. Cultures, environments, and other wonders and hazards vary wildly when PCs explore new places. The setting material found in this module can help GMs describe the places the PCs venture, and the rules in Chapter 11 of the core-rulebook explain how to adjudicate the PCs\u2019 adventures in strange and hazardous places with regard to their statistics and abilities. Tactical Combat When the PCs confront or are accosted by a creature or character, the game shifts to tactical combat. Tactical combat involves characters moving around a tactical battle map, attacking or other special abilities, and defending themselves from their enemies. In Starfinder, attacking generally involves rolling a 20-sided die, adding modifiers to the result, and comparing the total to enemy statistics such as Armor Class to determine whether a target is hit. When their attacks hit, characters deal a variable amount of damage depending on their weapons and statistics. But of course, the enemy can do the same thing to them! Full details about Starfinder\u2019s tactical rules can be found in Chapter 8 of the core-rulebook. Starship Combat In combat between starships, the PCs pilot their ship around a starship battle map, trying to maneuver into the best position to fire on their enemies without being hit themselves. Full details about Starfinder\u2019s starship combat rules can be found in Chapter 9.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"overview/#overview","text":"","title":"Overview"},{"location":"overview/#what-is-in-this-module","text":"This module does not contain all the information that is required to play the Star Citizen Module of Starfinder.

If there\u2019s a computer or machine that needs to be fixed, bypassed, or destroyed, you\u2019re the first on the scene. Whether you\u2019re a skilled scientist, a starship engineer, or a battlefield technician, you\u2019re no stranger to combat\u2014but you find it much more reasonable to have your AI or drone do the fighting for you. Hit Points: 6 Stamina Points: 6 + Constitution Modifier Key Ability Score You rely on your Intelligence for your knowledge, skills, and technical know-how, so Intelligence is your key ability score.

Mechanic tricks all require you to meet a minimum mechanic level, and they are organized accordingly. Some mechanic tricks require you to satisfy other prerequisites, such as having other tricks. Drones See Mechanic in the Core-Rulebook for more information Exocortex See Mechanic in the Core-Rulebook for more information Artificial Intelligence [Level: 1] You construct an artificial intelligence (or AI), a sophisticated program of self-motivated code that you can access for help in a variety of endeavors. This AI is the product of your own genius, far more advanced and complicated than any available for sale to consumers (though it falls short of being truly self-aware), and only you know the secrets of its creation and operation. Your AI can take one of two forms: a drone or an exocortex. You must pick one of these forms upon taking your first level of mechanic, and once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Drone You begin play with a powerful robotic drone to house your AI. You build and control this drone, which accompanies you on your adventures and is capable of combat, espionage, and other specialized tasks. As you gain levels, your drone advances in sophistication and gain additional abilities. While the value of your drone is immense, only you, with your extensive knowledge of its quirks and security measures, can ever hope to operate or repair it. Exocortex You begin play with an exocortex, an artificial processor that interacts with and augments your biological brain\u2019s cognitive functions, which can aid you in a variety of tasks, from combat to digital infiltration. Your exocortex is implanted within your physical body or brain, similar to a piece of cybernetic hardware, allowing your AI to access your mind and feed you information. As you gain levels, your exocortex advances in sophistication and processing power. Only you can access or interact with your exocortex. Bypass [Level: 1] You are skilled at getting inside computer systems and electronic devices. At 1st level, you gain a +1 insight bonus to Computers and Engineering skill checks. At 5th level, every 4 levels thereafter, and at 20th level, this bonus increases by 1. Custom Rig [Level: 1] You have created a customized toolkit you can use to hack systems and items. Your custom rig can be configured to take up an upgrade slot on your armor or can be installed as a cybernetic augmentation system in your brain (though it can be combined with a datajack for the same price as installing a datajack normally), your eyes, or an arm. For more information, see augmentations. Alternatively, you can configure it to be a handheld device, meaning that you must retrieve it and hold it to use it effectively. While using this rig, you always count as having the appropriate tool or basic kit for any Computers or Engineering skill check you attempt. Some mechanic tricks and drone mods require the use of a custom rig. In addition, you can use your custom rig as a Mk I comm unit. Finally, if you have a drone, you can use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your drone to issue commands to its AI or directly control it at a range of 2,500 feet. If your custom rig is damaged, destroyed, lost, or stolen, you can kitbash a new one from any engineering kit, hacking kit, or other technological toolkit, reconfiguring the materials into a new custom rig with 1 hour of work. You can have only one custom rig at a time. If you create a new custom rig, your old one functions as a normal toolkit of whatever type you made it from and can no longer be used with your mechanic tricks. Mechanic Trick [Level: 2] As you gain experience, you learn tricks that allow you to perform wonders of engineering, aid in electronic infiltrations, and optimize gear. While some of these are things you learn, others are small cybernetic enhancements you make to yourself (none of which have a price or count against your augmentation limits). Some tricks require the use of a custom rig or other gear. You learn your first mechanic trick at 2nd level, and you learn an additional mechanic trick at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter. If a mechanic trick allows an opponent a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier. If a mechanic trick requires an opponent to attempt a skill check, the DC is equal to 10 + 1-1/2 \u00d7 your class level + your Intelligence modifier. Unless otherwise specified, you can\u2019t learn mechanic tricks more than once. Overload [Level: 3] As a standard action, you can cause a short in an electronic device, including most ranged energy weapons, melee weapons with the powered special property, or a single armor upgrade. This makes the device nonfunctional for 1 round. Overload doesn\u2019t cause a locked door, safe, or other device to open, but it prevents anyone from opening it for 1 round. You must be adjacent to the device to use this ability. If you have a drone, you can instead use this ability on an electronic device adjacent to your drone. If you have an exocortex with the wireless hack ability, you can instead use this ability on any electronic device within range of your exocortex\u2019s wireless hack. If you use overload on an item or armor upgrade in someone\u2019s possession, the owner can attempt a Reflex saving throw to negate the effect (DC = 10 + half your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier). Overload doesn\u2019t affect androids, cybernetics, drones, powered armor, robots, or creatures with the technological subtype (all of which have shielding against this sort of attack), or items larger than Medium. Once a device has been successfully overloaded, a residual static charge prevents that device from being overloaded again for 1 minute. Weapon Specialization [Level: 3] You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type with which this class grants you proficiency. Remote Hack [Level: 5] You can use your custom rig to attempt Computers and Engineering skill checks at a range of 20 feet. At 7th level and every 2 levels thereafter, this range increases by 10 feet. A target of this ability (or a creature attending or observing your target) can attempt a Perception or Sense Motive check (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 \u00d7 your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier) to determine that you are the origin of this activity. Expert Rig [Level: 7] Your custom rig has improved. Whenever you use your custom rig to successfully hack into a computer, you can also disable one countermeasure installed in the system (except firewalls). In addition, your custom rig can now be used as any engineering or hacking specialty kit of item level 6th or lower, and it has the features of a computer with a tier equal to half your level with the artificial personality, hardened, or security I upgrade module. It also has an audio/video recorder. You can add extra modules or countermeasures to your custom rig at the normal prices. See page 213 for more information on computers. You can also use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your ship, allowing you to access your ship\u2019s downloaded data sets and transponder (see page 430) at a range of 5 miles. If you have a drone, you can issue commands to or directly control your drone at the same range. Miracle Worker [Level: 7] As a move action, you can repair damage to a starship\u2019s systems or modify a suit of armor or weapon to function more efficiently. To use this ability, you must be able to handle the item affected without impediment. You can use this ability once per day at 7th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 mechanic levels you have beyond 7th. The exact effect of this ability depends on the object or system you are modifying. Armor: You grant a +2 enhancement bonus to a suit of armor\u2019s EAC and KAC for 1 minute. Weapon: You grant a +2 enhancement bonus to a weapon\u2019s attack and damage rolls for 1 minute. Damaged Ship: You restore a number of Hull Points equal to the starship's base frame HP increment. If this raises the ship\u2019s HP over a multiple of its Critical Threshold, you can repair critical damage to one system per multiple, reducing its severity by one step. For example, if your starship\u2019s Critical Threshold is 8 and you restore 10 HP, reducing the damage to the hull from 17 HP to 7 HP, you could restore one system from wrecked to glitching. Using this ability during starship combat is your action for the turn, and you can do it only during the engineering phase. See page 292 for more on ship construction and page 320 for more on damage to ships. Override [Level: 9] Your overload class feature now affects androids, drones, robots, and creatures with the technological subtype, which must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier) or be dazed for 1 round. If the target fails its saving throw by 10 or more, it is not dazed and you can dictate its actions for 1 round, though these actions can\u2019t be obviously self-destructive. Once a creature has attempted a saving throw against this attack (regardless of the result), it is immune to this attack for 24 hours. Coordinated Assault [Level: 11] If you have a drone, whenever both you and your drone make attacks against the same target, you each receive a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack rolls. If you have an exocortex instead, whenever you and your exocortex are both attempting to hack a system, you each receive a +1 circumstance bonus to the checks to gain access. In either case, these bonuses increase to +2 at 17th level. Advanced Rig [Level: 13] Your custom rig\u2019s computer functions gain a bonus firewall countermeasure (see page 217). This firewall has no additional cost, does not count against the maximum number of countermeasures your custom rig can have, and can block off a module or group of modules already protected by a firewall. In addition, you can use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your ship, allowing you to access the ship\u2019s sensors, control its security systems, and prepare its engines for takeoff (as well as use the encrypted communications functions of your expert rig) at a range of 50 miles. If you have a drone, you can issue commands to or directly control your drone over an encrypted channel at the same range. Control Net [Level: 17] You are capable of operating multiple AIs, one in a drone and one in an exocortex. You must divide up your mechanic level between these different AIs, and each gains abilities based on the number of levels you assign to it. Every time you gain a level in mechanic, you can change the distribution of levels between these AIs using your custom rig after 24 hours of uninterrupted work. While each AI can act independently to the limits of its ability, you can control them as normal (although you can directly control only one AI at a time). If the number of levels assigned to your exocortex is less than your mechanic level, your exocortex grants a smaller increase to your base attack bonus when using combat tracking (see page 79), as noted in the table below. You gain additional exocortex abilities, such as wireless hack and multitasking, based upon the level you assign to it as normal. LEVELS ASSIGNED INCREASE TO BASE ATTACK BONUS 1-4 +1 5\u20138 +2 9-12 +3 13\u201316 +4 17\u201320 +5 Ghost in the Machine [Level: 19] When using your override class feature to affect an android, drone, robot, or creature with the technological subtype, a target that fails its saving throw by any amount is not dazed, and you can instead dictate its actions for the next round. These actions can\u2019t be obviously self-destructive. Once a creature has attempted a saving throw against this attack (regardless of the result), it is immune to this attack for 24 hours unless you spend 1 Resolve Point. You can continue to spend Resolve Points in this manner each round to make the creature susceptible to override again. Superior Rig [Level: 19] Your custom rig\u2019s computer functions now gain bonus lockout and wipe countermeasures. You can use your custom rig normally even when its lockout is active (you have special authorization no one else can access under any circumstances), and while any wiped data cannot be recovered by anyone else (as if the data module were destroyed), you can automatically recover it with 8 hours of work. These countermeasures have no additional cost and do not count against the maximum number of countermeasures your custom rig can have. Additionally, you can use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your ship at a range encompassing a planet and its close orbit, allowing you to remotely pilot your starship from point to point on the same planet or to and from orbit (as well as use the encrypted communications functions of your expert and advanced rig at the same range). If you have a drone, you can issue commands to or directly control your drone over an encrypted channel at the same range. Tech Master [Level: 20] You are a master of technology. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to craft any technological weapon, armor, or item at a rate of 1 minute per item level or spend 1 Resolve Point to convert any existing technological armor or weapon into another suit of armor or another weapon of equal or lesser value at a rate of 1 minute per item level. This uses the normal crafting rules presented on page 235, but the item being converted counts as its full value in crafting components. You cannot convert a one- handed weapon into a two-handed weapon. When converting an item into a cheaper item, any excess value is lost and cannot be reclaimed by converting the item back.","title":"Engineer"},{"location":"classes/engineer/#engineer","text":"You are a master of machines, from advanced supercomputers to simple magnetic engines.

Further details about wearing armor are below. Armor Proficiency If you are wearing armor with which you are not proficient, you take a \u20134 penalty to both EAC and KAC. A character who is proficient only with light armor can wear heavier armor effectively by selecting the Heavy Armor Proficiency feat. Donning Armor The time required to don or remove armor depends on its type. Light armor requires 4 rounds to don or remove, while heavy armor requires 16 rounds to don or remove. Armor that is at least 8th level but less than 16th level takes half the normal time to don or remove. Armor of 16th level or higher takes one-quarter the normal time to don or remove, to a minimum of one full action. Modern suits of armor are designed so that you can don or remove armor without assistance. Don Hastily You can hastily don armor in half the normal time, to a minimum of one full action. The armor check penalty, maximum Dexterity bonus, and armor bonus for hastily donned armor are each 1 worse than normal. Environmental Protections Space can be an inhospitable place, with countless dangerous worlds within it. Unless otherwise specified, all armors protect you from a range of hazards to ensure that you can survive for at least a few days if you must make emergency repairs to the hull of a starship, explore an alien world, or endure exposure to an environmental breach in a space station. Some armors do this through an environmental field (a minor force field specially attuned to pressure and temperature that does not reduce damage from attacks), while others can be closed with helmets and airtight seals. The most common environmental dangers are detailed in Environment. Activation and Duration A suit of armor\u2019s environmental protections last for a number of days equal to its item level. Activating or deactivating these environmental protections takes a standard action if you are wearing the suit (assuming the armor was properly donned). If you have access to a suit that is unattended or worn by a helpless creature, you can turn on its environmental protection as a full action, but turning it off requires a Computers check to hack the system, treating the suit as a computer with a tier equal to half the suit\u2019s item level (the base DC to hack a computer is equal to 13 + 4 per tier). The duration of a suit\u2019s environmental protections does not need to be expended all at once, but it must be expended in 1-hour increments. Recharging this duration requires access to a functioning starship or an environment recharging station (publicly available in most technologically advanced or average settlements) and takes 1 minute per day recharged. Most of the recharging stations that replenish devices, such as batteries and power cells (see page 234), also recharge armor\u2019s environmental protections, and using them to recharge suits is typically free of price. All other functions on a suit of armor with no duration remaining still work normally. Breathing and Pressure All armor can facilitate self-contained breathing, protecting you against vacuums, smoke, and thick, thin, and toxic atmospheres (including any airborne poison or disease). Self-contained breathing functions underwater and in similar liquid environments. This protection allows you to breathe in a corrosive atmosphere (see page 395) to prevent suffocation, but it isn\u2019t strong enough to prevent a corrosive atmosphere from dealing acid damage to both you and your armor. A suit of armor with an upgrade that grants acid resistance reduces any acid damage taken from a corrosive atmosphere normally. Any vision impairment from the environment (such as smoke or water) still applies. Radiation Armor protects you against low levels of radiation (see page 403) and grants a +4 circumstance bonus to saving throws against higher levels of radiation. Armor of 7th level and higher grants immunity to medium radiation levels and provides a +6 circumstance bonus to saving throws against higher levels of radiation. No armor\u2019s bonuses apply to saves against radiation sickness, regardless of the level of radiation exposure that caused you to contract it. Temperature Armor\u2019s environmental protections reasonably protect you against both cold (temperatures below \u201320\u00b0 F) and heat (air temperatures over 140\u00b0 F). This prevents you from having to attempt Fortitude saving throws to avoid damage from the environment, and it prevents you from taking any damage listed for breathing in the environment. This does not protect against cold or fire damage from other sources or against environments that deal damage without allowing a Fortitude saving throw or breathing the atmosphere (such as lava).) Reading Armor Tables Each entry on the armor tables describes a single suit of armor, with the following statistics. - Level: The armor\u2019s item level (See Starfinder Core Rulebook Chapter 7). - Price: This is the price in credits of the suit of armor. - EAC Bonus: This is the bonus your armor adds to your Energy Armor Class, which protects against attacks from laser weapons, plasma cannons, and the like (See Starfinder Core Rulebook Chapter 7). - KAC Bonus: This is the bonus your armor adds to your Kinetic Armor Class, which protects against projectiles, most melee weapons, and other solid objects (See Starfinder Core Rulebook Chapter 7). - Maximum Dex Bonus: You normally add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class (for both EAC and KAC), but it\u2019s limited by your armor. Your armor\u2019s maximum Dexterity bonus indicates how much of your Dexterity modifier you can add to AC. Any excess Dexterity doesn\u2019t raise your AC further and is simply ignored for this purpose. - Armor Check Penalty: You take a penalty to most Strengthand Dexterity-based skill checks equal to this number. See Chapter 5 for a more complete list of which skills apply. Speed Adjustment: While wearing the armor, your speed is adjusted by this number. - Upgrade Slots: You can improve your armor with magic and technological upgrades. This entry shows how many total upgrades your armor can accommodate. Some armor upgrades are larger or more complicated and take up multiple upgrade slots (See Starfinder Core Rulebook Chapter 7) - Bulk: This is the bulk of the item (See Starfinder Core Rulebook Chapter 7).

Currency - UEC Shortly after the creation of the United Planets of Earth, Humanity\u2019s expansion into the galaxy was increasing at an exponential rate.

It was this rapid expansion and colonization that created the first real hurdle for the newly-formed UPE. Various and competing forms of currencies had begun to appear on the various planets, challenging the Cash Transaction Records, or CTRs, the UPE\u2019s official currency at the time. In the turmoil of multiple currencies a commission was formed and ultimately decided the entire currency system needed to be overhauled. Local governments were forbidden by the UPE from creating their own currencies andso they could bring all the various planets under on econsistent and unified form of currency. This is how the United Earth Credit (UEC) was born. The UPE also setup the Central Core Bank to create and administer the monetary policy, to conduct foreign exchange operations and monitor the banking sector. Most importantly, the Central Core Bank would maintain reserves to provide the financial backing that could honor the Credit attached to each UEC. It took several years for the UEC to take over as the official currency but when it did it also attracted the attention of the Banu Protectorate who were looking to solve a similar issue. Years later when UPE went through a title change to the United Empire of Earth (UEE) they UEC held true, although it now hold different names through out the 'verse.

This section is meant to include all that is required to play in the Star Citizen Universe but it's by no means a final be-all end-all list to the weapons or even types of weapons. At your GM's descretion you can use any of the items listed in Chapter 7 of the Starfinder Core Rulebook. However, there is one important point of consieration. Star Citizen is a high tech level/No magic setting. So all magic items and magic infusion should be left out or strongly discouraged when playing in this setting. Weapon Damage Weapon Damage types are denoted next to the damage Role and are as follows Energy Damage Damange Type Symbol Description Acid A Damage dealt by corrosive substances and effects. Cold C Damage dealt by ice and cryogenic energy. Electricity E Damage dealt by lightning and other electric shocks. Fire F Damage dealt by flames, lasers, and extreme heat. Sonic So Damage dealt by loud noise or damaging frequencies. Kinetic Gamage Damange Type Symbol Description Bludgeoning B Damage from blunt force. Piercing P Damage from spikes, bullets, and punctures. Slashing S Damage from blades, claws, and sharp edges. Melee Weapons Star Citizen is currently lacking in melee weapons and has spent most of their time working on ranged weapons.

Individual weapons are described in Weapon Descriptions. The descriptions are organized primarily by weapon category (cryo, flame, laser, plasma, projectile, shock, sonic, and uncategorized). Not all weapons and ammunition have all the entries listed here. Melee weapons and ammunition don\u2019t have range, shot, or rate of fire. Ammunition lists the number of cartridges or charges provided when purchased. Level: The weapon or ammunition\u2019s item level. Price: The typical market price of the weapon or ammunition. Damage: The amount of damage you roll when you hit with the weapon is listed here, along with an abbreviation for the damage type the weapon deals: A for acid, B for bludgeoning, C for cold, E for electricity, F for fire, P for piercing, S for slashing, and So for sonic. See Weapon Damage for more information. Range: The range increment of a ranged weapon. Critical: On a critical hit, a weapon\u2019s damage is rolled twice. This entry lists any additional effect the weapon has when you score a critical hit against a target. For more information about additional critical effects, see Critical Hit Effects. Capacity: A weapon\u2019s capacity measures the largest-capacity battery it can hold (given in number of charges), the number of rounds of ammunition its magazine can hold, the amount of fuel it carries, or the number of individual cartridges, grenades, or missiles it can hold. When a weapon entry states that its capacity is drawn, it means that you can hold only one such weapon in the number of hands required to use it. You can hold only a single grenade or shuriken in one hand, you can have only one arrow nocked at a time, and you can wield only one net at a time. Drawing a weapon\u2014such as grabbing a grenade from your belt\u2014requires a move action. Drawing a weapon might be different than wielding it. Usage: This listing shows how much ammunition is consumed with each attack you make with the weapon: The number of rounds from a magazine, the number of battery charges from a charged weapon, and so on. Bulk: This is the bulk of the item. Special: Any special properties of the weapon or ammunition are listed here (see Weapon Special Properties).","title":"Weapons"},{"location":"equipment/weapons/#weapons","text":"The Universe is a dangerous place, whether you're on a simple mining operation or aiding local security in a raid of a security post, you'll probably find yourself with a pistol on your hip or rifle over your shoulder.

Physical Description Humans have a wide range of inherited traits, such as body type, skin color, and facial features, yet these minor differences of heredity and genetics hold little significance in modern human society. Instead, humans\u2019 tendency to adapt to their environments means that more extreme differences, such as cybernetic augmentations, alien implants, and the elongated limbs of zero-g asteroid miners, are seen as far more important than ancient geography or skin color when defining modern ethnic groups. Home World This should be pretty familiar to youEarth (Sol III): cradle of Humanity, heart of the Empire, birthplace of mankind \u2026 and a difficult place to turn a profit. It's no secret that Earth is set in its ways. All roads lead to Earth and the system is designed to support native-born Humans above all others. Tax policies support Earth-based corporations at the extreme disadvantage of those based on worlds like Terra, while representation in the UEE Senate continues to skew disproportionately in favor of Earth's populace. Put simply, Earth is the capital and namesake of the United Empire of Earth and it is the seat of power that governs everything from rising systems like Terra to distant colony worlds that barely impact the homeworlds' economies. Home to the Imperator and the UEE Senate, Earth sets the standards for everything that happens in the Empire, from moderating economic models, to setting social trends, to organizing military campaigns. While other more strategically located star systems, like Terra, have begun to make claims for higher standing in the Empire, Earth is still the acknowledged center of the universe. Contrarily, Earth wants for everything. Thousands of years of Human civilization have left many of the planet's natural resources exhausted and the system imports trillions upon trillions of tons of food, raw metals, manufactured goods and everything else imaginable. If it were not for the so-called \"balance tariffs\" keeping prices uncompetitive, this would be an ideal situation for any erstwhile shipping magnate. As it is, a run to Earth can barely be guaranteed to provide more than a 5% profit \u2026 and that's before you get to the exorbitant docking and refueling fees for spacecraft carrying other systems' registration numbers. Earth is also safe, to an extreme. The UEE military, Advocacy and various police arms patrol the system ceaselessly and they are notoriously uncompromising when it comes to punishing wrongdoers in the system. There is no faster way to get an extremely high bounty on your head than to commit a crime, even a minor infraction, in space near Earth. The military dockyards in Earth orbit are home port to no less than five Bengal-class carriers and at least one is dry-docked at any given time. The planet itself is pockmarked with starports, a natural evolution of nearly a millennium of Human space travel. Three of these have taken the throne as the significant import/export centers of the world: New York in North America, Moscow in Europe and Shanghai in Asia. Society and Alignment The diversity of human societies makes them both fascinating and frustrating to other races. Human settlements just a few miles apart may have wildly different governmental styles and social mores, and one faction may promote violent, xenophobic conquest while another wants only trade and friendship. If there\u2019s anything that can be said about human society as a whole, it\u2019s that it\u2019s always in flux, with even the oldest cultures constantly adapting and reinventing themselves\u2014a trait that often leads to humanity being seen as a \u201cyounger\u201d race, regardless of the millennia it has existed. As a result, humans cannot be said to lean toward any particular alignment\u2014though many aliens might argue that this marks them as chaotic. Relations Humans are the glue that holds the rest of the solar system together. Their seemingly endless desire to explore and settle any habitable environment has positioned them perfectly to act as traders and mediators between other races, and their lack of their own planet often makes integrating into other cultures attractive to them. At the same time, not every race appreciates their viruslike spread. Vanduul Since their first encounter in the Orion system, Humans and Vanduuls have been waging a merciless war. The UEE diplomats tried well to approach the clans, but nothing could calm this cultural war which does not seem to have an end. Banu The first race humanity encountered during its ascent to space, it has always kept a cordial understanding with humanity, and a peace agreement in principle exists. The Banus do a lot of business, and this is a more than sufficient vector of understanding for the UEE. Xi'an The meeting with the Xi'An was the most tense period in the history of the UEE. Messerian totalitarianism weakened relations with the Xi'An from the first contact, triggering a long period of cold war leaving a constant doubt of open war. With the advent of the UEE and the fall of the Messers, this period came to an end for the more pleasant and peace-loving period we know today. Tevarin There isn\u2019t an official Tevarin civilization or government, as the race has almost been completely eradicated and its homeworld has been rendered uninhabitable for the Tevarin, effectively making them a dying race. A few showcase Tevarin have been given Citizenship to display the UEE\u2019s tolerance, but total Tevarin Citizens might be measured in triple (or even double) digits. The most notable of these showcase citizens is Suj Kossi, a UEE Navy veteran and Medal of Valor recipient who is currently running in the Jalan senatorial election. Adventurers Ambition and desire for action are hallmarks of humanity, and countless humans leave home in search of wealth, fame, knowledge, excitement, or other means of bettering their situations. Since the discovery of the Quantum Travel and convenient interstellar travel, humans have led the charge in exploring and settling new worlds, driven by economic opportunity and ambition. Due to their versatility and adaptability, humans can fill any role in an adventuring party, from heavily armed soldier to charming envoy ambassador. Names Human names can be totally new inventions, local traditions, words borrowed from alien languages, or artifacts harkening back to cultures on vanished Golarion. Due to the absence of records from the Gap, it\u2019s nearly impossible for individuals to trace their genealogy back to Golarion itself, and thus any names pulled from ancient history are claimed rather than true ethnic traditions. Some examples of human names are Akif, Alezandaru, Amare, Baolo, Belor, Darilian, Hadzi, Hai Minh, Hiriko, Iolana, Jokug, Korva, Morvius, Navasi, Pao, Pasara, Raziya, Revhi, Sahba, Sephia, Signe, Valki, and Yon.","title":"Human"},{"location":"races/human/#humans","text":"Ambitious, creative, and endlessly curious, humans have shown more drive to explore their system and the universe beyond than any of their neighbor races\u2014for better and for worse.

Low Light Vision: All Tevarin can see in dim light as if it were normal light. Size and Type Tevarin are Medium humanoids Homeworld Formerly known as Kaleeth, it has since been terraformed, colonized by Humans, and renamed to Elysium IV. In 2946, Suj Kossi, a UEE veteran, was the planet's first senator to come from the Tevarin population. Society and Alignment There is no official Tevarin government, as the race was destroyed to near extinction in its war with humanity and the survivors assimilated into the UEE. However, a few Tevarin have been given Citizenship to display the UEE's tolerance for xenos, but the total number of Tevarin Citizens might be measured in triple or even double digits. Most other Tevarin lack any political affiliation to a party, generally ignoring the human-centric politics of the UEE with a sort of bland apathy. Current Representation Regardless of having been assimilated into the UEE for more than 300 years, some human groups still hold grudges against the Tevarin. A particularly xenophobic hate-group known as Nemesis has been known to commit voter suppression against Tevarin. In one case, during the secondary votes of the 2950 UEE imperatorial Election, it was revealed that Nemesis would strategically deploy themselves near polling stations where high populations of Tevarin were known to live, intimidating them and denying them access. An example of a group that currently fights against this repression is the Tevarin advocacy group Stronger Together, founded in 2941. They routinely provide free legal representation for Tevarin who can't afford it and guide others through the complicated Citizenship application process. They monitor activity of anti-Tevarin hate groups and collate data of xenophobic crimes from all UEE systems. Religion Originally the Tevarin followed Rijora (/REE-jorr-ah/), a warrior-code similar to Bushid\u014d on ancient Earth. The Tevarin believed in honor, fealty, and duty above all else. Breaking this strict code meant excommunication, or even execution in extreme cases. After their defeat in the first war and the loss of their homeworld, the code began to decline in popularity. As a response to this, the Second Tevarin War was launched in an attempt to reclaim the Tevarin race's previous glory. However, this second war failed miserably. Consequently, when the last diehard believers of Rijora flung themselves toward Kaleeth, burning up in the atmosphere and crashing into the planet, the last chance for the Tevarin to reclaim their place in the galaxy had been lost. Following this final defeat the vast majority of surviving Tevarin abandoned their religion in a climatic period known as The Purge. Tragically, almost all Tevarin destroyed their Codices, which are the holy writs of Rijora. Relations Since the Tevarin are a vanishing race they are somewhat assimilated into the human society. In the present day there is an anger and deep sadness to be found in most Tevarin. Their people are diminished and scattered, and the loss of their religion, their culture, and their homeworld has had a profound psychological effect on their race. Truly, theirs is the melancholy of a broken, declining people. After the second war, many Tevarin channeled their aggressive natures into addictions and violence. Indeed, Tevarin mercenaries are noted for their ruthlessness and utter lack of fear. However, the average Tevarin finds little joy in life. Most humans find Tevarin to be terse and cynical and this sentiment is seen towards all races.

A particularly xenophobic hate-group known as Nemesis has been known to commit voter suppression against Tevarin. In one case, during the secondary votes of the 2950 UEE imperatorial Election, it was revealed that Nemesis would strategically deploy themselves near polling stations where high populations of Tevarin were known to live, intimidating them and denying them access. An example of a group that currently fights against this repression is the Tevarin advocacy group Stronger Together, founded in 2941. They routinely provide free legal representation for Tevarin who can't afford it and guide others through the complicated Citizenship application process. They monitor activity of anti-Tevarin hate groups and collate data of xenophobic crimes from all UEE systems.","title":"Current Representation"},{"location":"races/tevarin/#religion","text":"Originally the Tevarin followed Rijora (/REE-jorr-ah/), a warrior-code similar to Bushid\u014d on ancient Earth. The Tevarin believed in honor, fealty, and duty above all else. Breaking this strict code meant excommunication, or even execution in extreme cases. After their defeat in the first war and the loss of their homeworld, the code began to decline in popularity. As a response to this, the Second Tevarin War was launched in an attempt to reclaim the Tevarin race's previous glory. However, this second war failed miserably. Consequently, when the last diehard believers of Rijora flung themselves toward Kaleeth, burning up in the atmosphere and crashing into the planet, the last chance for the Tevarin to reclaim their place in the galaxy had been lost. Following this final defeat the vast majority of surviving Tevarin abandoned their religion in a climatic period known as The Purge. Tragically, almost all Tevarin destroyed their Codices, which are the holy writs of Rijora.","title":"Religion"},{"location":"races/tevarin/#relations","text":"Since the Tevarin are a vanishing race they are somewhat assimilated into the human society. In the present day there is an anger and deep sadness to be found in most Tevarin. Their people are diminished and scattered, and the loss of their religion, their culture, and their homeworld has had a profound psychological effect on their race. Truly, theirs is the melancholy of a broken, declining people. After the second war, many Tevarin channeled their aggressive natures into addictions and violence. Indeed, Tevarin mercenaries are noted for their ruthlessness and utter lack of fear. However, the average Tevarin finds little joy in life. Most humans find Tevarin to be terse and cynical and this sentiment is seen towards all races.","title":"Relations"},{"location":"races/tevarin/#names","text":"Examples of Tevarin names are as follows: Corath'Thal, Nescus, Suj Kossi","title":"Names"},{"location":"races/vanduul/","text":"Vanduul The Vanduul (pronounced: / Van-DOOL /) are a race in Star Citizen.

A note about playing Vanduul Due to the many wars fought with the Vanduul if you are playing it in a primarily human setting you're setting yourself up for some very hard times. While you will definitely be an imposing force combatively you and your party will like suffer incredibly harsh prejudice particularly in UEE space. This is not to dissuade you from playing as a Vanduul character just a word of caution. Size and Type Xi'an are Medium humanoids Homeworld It is unknown if the Vanduul currently have a homeworld. Their homeplanet may have been destroyed or abandoned, which scattered the Vanduul clans into a nomadic lifestyle in their ships. On the other hand, it is unknown where young and female Vanduul live. Genetic analysis of X12' crew showed that all subjects had a diverse gene pool, which suggest that Hordes or Clans consist of not closely related individuals. It is possible that Clans and Hordes (which are only consisting of male individuals) are formed by a selection procedure on their homeworld and spend the rest of their life with their clan. Society and Alignment The political system of the Vanduul has been described as a meritocracy, the political philosophy in which power and wealth are given to the most talented members of a society. There is little to no communication between the different roaming clans. Each fleet operates as its own society with its own independent set of rules, laws and customs as decreed by that clan's Chieftain. As such, it is probably impossible to make peace or establish diplomatic relations with the Vanduul as a whole since there is no cohesive civilization. Vanduul do not hold permanent settlements and therefore do not claim land in their occupied systems. They eliminate every threat, raiding and pillaging the surface of an occupied planet with specialized Harvesters and then moving to a new location once the planet has been thoroughly drained of all resources. It seems that they are not interested in preserving their potential \"pasture grounds\", which could be a reason for their nomadic and expansionist lifestyle. Vanduul's family structure is also very distinct from Humanity. There is one tradition that exists throughout all of the Vanduul; once a child reaches adulthood (usually around the equivalent of Human 13\u201314 years), they are banished from their family. Before they go, the parents will fashion a knife for their child. This knife will be the child's only possession as he/she sets out into adulthood. Consequently, these knives are treasured possessions that they keep for the rest of their lives. They will receive no money, housing, or support of any kind from their former family. Everything that the newly recognized adult achieves starts with the knife and grows from there. Therefore, there is no hereditary transfer of money or influence. Religion Due to the cultural emphasis on solidarity, the idea of higher powers aiding or affecting an individual's life has never caught on with Vanduul society. Therefore, the 'self' is held in high regard, so the closest thing to a Vanduul religion is the admiration of a specific person and what he or she was able to achieve.

To simplify working dealing with large amounts of ammunition each weapon is given ammo DC, after firing you will roll a d20 and if your roll is below the DC you will lower the ammo of the ship. Example: The P52 Merlin fires it's nose gatling and has an ammo dc of 12 and a total ammo of 10. After firing the pilot will roll an ammo check and rolls an 8, bringing the ammo down to a 9. The next round they fire and roll a 13, the ammo stays at a 9 giving the pilot another another round of fire. Alternatively: For players that like less randomness in their games they can take 1.5 x the ammo score on the ship as their total rounds of sustained fire. Could potentially give you more or less fire than this. Ballistic: Ballistic weapons fire a solid or explosive projectile at a high speed, using the ship's limited store of ammunition. Ballistic weapons penetrate enemy shields and deal the remaining damage diretly to the hull. Half damage should go to shield (rounded up) and half to the hull. Example: the P-52 gatling deals 3d6 damage and rolls a 15, 8 would hit the shields and 7 would hit the hull, until the shield has been depleted. Distortion: Distortion weapons are a unique derivative of energy weapons that inflict intense electrical discharges rather than thermal damage. Distortion weapons never damage HP, All damage is first focused on the shield. Once the shield are down the damage is delivered directly to the PPU points Example: a cutlass blue has has distorion cannons equipped and does 2 x 6d8 distortion damage (lets pretend it's max damage of 96 damage) to a Constellation Andromeda which has 50 remaining shield points and 220 PPU points. 50 damage would hit the shields and the remaining 46 would take the PPU to 174. Energy: Energy weapons are Lasers focus light through lens arrays into a maser bottle. From there they are used to create neutron guns, masers, plasma, or other energy types to damage both shields and ships. The shield systems take damage from energy systems and once the shields are temporarily depleted, the energy weapons starts melting the targeted ship. Specifically Damage is dealt to shields first, then to hull hp. Powered: Energy weapons do not take any ammunition however they are powered by the powerplant, and produces additional load. If a ship takes distortion damage to the PPU then the given engineer will have to prioritize which if they want to power their guns or thrusters.","title":"Ship Components"},{"location":"ships/ship-components/#ship-components","text":"","title":"Ship Components"},{"location":"ships/ship-components/#power-plants","text":"Manufacturer Name Size Grade Class PPU Price Lightning Power Ltd.

To simplify working dealing with large amounts of ammunition each weapon is given ammo DC, after firing you will roll a d20 and if your roll is below the DC you will lower the ammo of the ship. Example: The P52 Merlin fires it's nose gatling and has an ammo dc of 12 and a total ammo of 10. After firing the pilot will roll an ammo check and rolls an 8, bringing the ammo down to a 9. The next round they fire and roll a 13, the ammo stays at a 9 giving the pilot another another round of fire. Alternatively: For players that like less randomness in their games they can take 1.5 x the ammo score on the ship as their total rounds of sustained fire. Could potentially give you more or less fire than this. Ballistic: Ballistic weapons fire a solid or explosive projectile at a high speed, using the ship's limited store of ammunition. Ballistic weapons penetrate enemy shields and deal the remaining damage diretly to the hull. Half damage should go to shield (rounded up) and half to the hull. Example: the P-52 gatling deals 3d6 damage and rolls a 15, 8 would hit the shields and 7 would hit the hull, until the shield has been depleted. Distortion: Distortion weapons are a unique derivative of energy weapons that inflict intense electrical discharges rather than thermal damage. Distortion weapons never damage HP, All damage is first focused on the shield. Once the shield are down the damage is delivered directly to the PPU points Example: a cutlass blue has has distorion cannons equipped and does 2 x 6d8 distortion damage (lets pretend it's max damage of 96 damage) to a Constellation Andromeda which has 50 remaining shield points and 220 PPU points. 50 damage would hit the shields and the remaining 46 would take the PPU to 174. Energy: Energy weapons are Lasers focus light through lens arrays into a maser bottle. From there they are used to create neutron guns, masers, plasma, or other energy types to damage both shields and ships. The shield systems take damage from energy systems and once the shields are temporarily depleted, the energy weapons starts melting the targeted ship. Specifically Damage is dealt to shields first, then to hull hp. Powered: Energy weapons do not take any ammunition however they are powered by the powerplant, and produces additional load. If a ship takes distortion damage to the PPU then the given engineer will have to prioritize which if they want to power their guns or thrusters.","title":"Weapon Properties"},{"location":"ships/ship-modules/","text":"Ship Modules/Expansion Bays Several ships are modular and those slots can be filled with expansion bays Size 1 Modules Small Cargo: Cargo for up to 5 tons of goods with no item being large than Small Small Passenger Seating: Contains Jump Seats for up to 8 passengers","title":"Ship Modules"},{"location":"ships/ship-modules/#ship-modulesexpansion-bays","text":"Several ships are modular and those slots can be filled with expansion bays","title":"Ship Modules/Expansion Bays"},{"location":"ships/ship-modules/#size-1-modules","text":"Small Cargo: Cargo for up to 5 tons of goods with no item being large than Small Small Passenger Seating: Contains Jump Seats for up to 8 passengers","title":"Size 1 Modules"},{"location":"ships/understanding-starships/","text":"UNDERSTANDING SHIPS Ships and their base frames are described using stat blocks that include information about how they move, the size of their crews, and more. When you\u2019re reading a ship or base frame stat block, the statistics and definitions below define its capabilities. A ship sheet is provided at the end of this book. Name and Tier: This is the designation of the ship and its power level. ships of different tiers vary to a greater degree in terms of power and abilities than monsters whose Challenge Rating (CR) differs by a similar amount. Size Category and Frame: This describes the overall size of the vessel (see ship Scale on page 294). A ship\u2019s size provides a modifier to its Armor Class and Target Lock (see below). This entry also notes the base frame of the ship (see page 294). Speed: This is the number of hexes the ship can move using most pilot actions. Maneuverability: A ship\u2019s maneuverability is rated clumsy, poor, average, good, or perfect. This is generally tied to the mass and size of the ship, and it both indicates how agile the ship is in space and determines the minimum number of hexes the ship must move before it can turn (see page 319). QT Rating: This is a ship\u2019s Quantum engine rating. When determining how long it takes a ship to travel to a location through the Quantum, divide the die roll by this number (see page 291). If this entry is absent, the ship can\u2019t travel into the Quantum. Armor Class (AC): This value is used when determining whether direct-fire weapons (see Type on page 303) hit a ship. AC is calculated based on the ship\u2019s size, maneuverability, and physical armor, as well as the pilot\u2019s number of ranks in the Piloting skill. See page 320 for details on calculating AC. Target Lock (TL): This value is used when determining whether tracking weapons (see Type on page 303) hit a ship. TL is calculated based on the ship\u2019s size, maneuverability, and defensive countermeasures (see page 298), plus the pilot\u2019s number of ranks in the Piloting skill. See page 320 for details. Hull Points (HP): This is the total amount of damage a ship can take before it becomes inoperative. A ship with 0 Hull Points isn\u2019t destroyed, though many of its systems are no longer functioning and it is no longer a threat to its enemies. In a base frame stat block, the Hull Points entry also lists the HP increment, which is the number of Hull Points a ship with that frame automatically gains when its tier increases to 4 (and every 4 tiers thereafter; see page 294). Damage Threshold (DT): If an attack deals less damage less than this value, that damage isn\u2019t counted against the ship\u2019s total Hull Points. Only Huge or larger ships have a Damage Threshold, and it matters only when such a ship\u2019s shields are depleted (see page 320). Critical Threshold (CT): Whenever the total amount of damage that has been dealt to a ship\u2019s Hull Points reaches a multiple of this value, one of its systems takes critical damage (see page 321). This value is always one-fifth of the ship\u2019s maximum number of Hull Points. Shields: In a ship stat block, this lists the ship\u2019s shield system and the Shield Points (SP), which represent the damage shields can take before they\u2019re depleted. Shield Points are assigned to particular quadrants (forward, port, starboard, or aft). These quadrants correspond in orientation to the firing arcs shown in the diagram on page 318. Attacks: A ship has four firing arcs: forward, port, starboard, and aft (see the diagram on page 318). Most nonturret weapons can fire only in the firing arc where they\u2019re mounted; turret weapons can be fired in any arc. The attack entries list the various weapons mounted on the ship that can fire in each of the arcs. Each weapon also lists its damage, range, and other special properties. Hardpoints: In a base frame stat block, this entry lists the class of weapon that can be mounted on the ship (see page 303). Power plant: This lists a ship\u2019s power plant (see page 296) and the power plant units (PPU) it produces. Quantum Engine: The ship\u2019s Quantum engine, if any, is listed here. Systems: This entry lists a ship\u2019s major systems, such as armor, defensive countermeasures, sensors, and weapons (see page 297). Expansion Bays: This entry lists any expansion bays\u2014cargo spaces that can be used for special purposes (see page 298). Modifiers: This entry lists the bonuses (or penalties) to certain skill checks during ship combat gained from a ship\u2019s speed and maneuverability, as well as from some ship systems. Minimum and Maximum Crew: In a base frame stat block, these entries note the minimum and maximum number of characters who can take actions on that vessel during ship combat. Larger ships use teams that report to a higher officer who performs an assigned role in ship combat (see Large and Small Crews on page 316 for more about large crews). A ship without its minimum crew can\u2019t be operated. Compliment: In a ship stat block, this section lists the total size of the crew aboard that ship. Crew: In a ship stat block, this section lists those filling various roles in combat (see page 316), as well as their bonuses to skills used during ship combat and number of ranks in those skills\u2014see page 316 for more on determining these. Any modifiers listed earlier in the stat block are accounted for here. If a ship has teams supporting officers who fill roles, this entry also lists the number and size of teams. This section is listed only for ships under the GM\u2019s control\u2014PCs can perform their own actions aboard ships they control; for more on these actions, see ship Combat on page 316. Special Abilities: Any unique actions or qualities a shiphas due to its crew or its equipment are listed here. Cost: In a base frame stat block, this lists the frame\u2019s Build Point cost. Build Points (BP) are an abstract resource used for creating and upgrading ships.","title":"Understanding Starships"},{"location":"ships/understanding-starships/#understanding-ships","text":"Ships and their base frames are described using stat blocks that include information about how they move, the size of their crews, and more.
