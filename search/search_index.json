I highly encourage you to go and purchase the original core-rulebook from Paizo . What is different in the Starfinder Citizen module Starfinder is a sci-fi take on the original Pathfinder high fantasy tabletop rpg. As such Starfinder includes a lot of fantasy elements into the the system. While you could opt to use it, Star Citizen is a high tech level/0 magic level campain settings. As such All skills, feats, classes, and rules regarding magic will not apply and will not be included in this module and setting. However I would like to point a few things we're adding to help with your Star Citizen Immersion. First while Starfinder has a lot of rules for Combat we will be: 1. Adding rules and tables for Mining and Salvaging. 2. Adding damage and healing system more similar to Star Citizen 3. Adding in Death of a Spaceman Rules 4. Adding Star Citizen Lore specific factions 5. Creating a library of In-Game and Concept Ships and weapons so you can pilot the ship of your dreams even if it's not out Flight Ready yet. Another key factor goal of this project is to expand beyond the basic rules of Starfinder, mostly a well balanced space opera and move it more into a Sandbox style game. While you may have a GM that is well prepared with adventures for you, a lot of the fun of Star Citizen is the emergent gameplay. This is the type of feel and adventure that we want to grow here, Great Emergent Stories. The emergent stories created in a sandbox game are different. The GM does not have a single prearranged story on hand that he expects to fit the players into; he has many potential stories, for many potential places, all of them locales that the players may or may not visit. He might have a general idea of the goals that the players wish to accomplish, or offer them particular plot hooks to catch their interest and focus their efforts, but he largely sits back and facilitates the stories that the players grow themselves. Luckily we already have fleshed out systems, planets, stations and factiosn for you to move around in and we will be providing you with the the tools that you will need for quick generation tools for plot hooks, places of interest, and adventure frameworks ready for elaboration. Getting Started Once you have your hands on the core-rulebook you may want to dive directly into the rules and character creation beginning in Chapter 2, or you may want to dig into the Star Citizen Lore, some of which will contained in this module while the rest can be found at Roberts Space Industries . For players Making Characters, Chapter 2 of the Core-Rulebook will provide you a step-by-step walk-through of the process that includes references to the relevant chapters. However, different from the rulebook rather than viewing Chapter 3 with information about the different core races, please use the descriptions under that Races Tab in this module. Basic Starfinder Concepts 1d6, d20, etc. These figures are abbreviations for die rolls and indicate which dice you roll to determine a variable number, such as the amount of damage a weapon deals. The first number tells you how many dice to roll, while the second number tells you the number of sides the die or dice must have; if there\u2019s no first number, just roll one die. For example, \u201croll 2d8\u201d means that you must roll two eight-sided dice, and \u201croll a d20\u201d means you must roll one 20-sided die. Occasionally, you may need to roll a d3; if you don\u2019t have a three-sided die, you can roll a d6 instead\u2014treat a roll of 1 or 2 as a 1, a roll of 3 or 4 as a 2, and a roll of 5 or 6 as a 3. Abbreviations Starfinder has many game terms that are typically expressed as abbreviations, including HP (Hit Points), SP (Stamina Points), and RP (Resolve Points). If you miss or forget what an abbreviation means, they\u2019re explained in the glossary starting on page 512 (of the core-rulebook). Armor Class (AC) This is a number representing how hard it is for an enemy to strike your character in combat. A character has two Armor Classes: Energy Armor Class (EAC) and Kinetic Armor Class (KAC). Attack Roll An attack roll is a d20 roll that represents your character\u2019s attempt to strike another creature in combat. Check A check is a d20 roll that may or may not be modified by your character\u2019s statistics or another value. The most common types are skill checks and ability checks (which determine whether you successfully perform a task), and initiative checks (which determine when you act in combat). Combat Typically, references to combat refer to tactical combat between individual characters, which takes place on a square-gridded battle map and is covered in depth in Chapter 8. Combat can instead refer to starship combat, which uses a hex map; you can find the details of that system in Chapter 9. Creature A creature is an active participant in the story or world. This includes player characters (PCs), nonplayer characters (NPCs), and monsters. Difficulty Class (DC) This is the target number a creature must meet or exceed when attempting a check in order to accomplish a given task. Encounter An encounter is a situation that presents characters with a challenge. This could be a roleplaying challenge where they need to get information, a physical battle, a trap or puzzle, or anything else that requires players to use their wits or their characters\u2019 statistics. Characters typically earn experience points for completing encounters. Experience Points (XP) Often just called \u201cexperience,\u201d this is a way of tracking your character\u2019s increasing expertise gained as a result of overcoming challenges. When characters earn enough experience points, they advance in level, or \u201clevel up\u201d (see Leveling Up on page 26). Game Master (GM) The Game Master is the player who adjudicates the rules and controls the various elements of the Starfinder story and world that the players explore. A GM\u2019s duty is to provide a fair and fun game\u2014she wants the other players to ultimately succeed in their goals, but only after much heroic striving and danger. Hit Points (HP) and Stamina Points (SP) Stamina Points represent how much damage you can take before you\u2019re actually hurt, while Hit Points represent how badly hurt you can be before you fall unconscious or die. Stamina Points are lost before Hit Points and are much easier to regain. For a more detailed explanation, see page 22. Level A level is an indication of relative power within the game. There are several types of levels. Class level is the number of levels of a specific class that a character has. Character level is the sum of all of the levels a character has in all of her classes. Level can also refer to an item\u2019s level, or another scaling mechanic that falls within the framework of the game\u2019s rules. Modifier A modifier is a number that is added to a roll such as an attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. It can be positive or negative. Monster A monster is a nonplayer character. In general, monsters are too strange or unintelligent to be player characters, or are prevented from being them for other reasons. A monster might be a player character\u2019s opponent or ally, or serve any other role. Nonplayer Character (NPC) A nonplayer character is controlled by the GM for the purpose of interacting with players and helping advance the story. Player Character (PC) This is a character controlled by a player. Roleplaying Describing a character\u2019s actions, often while play-acting from the perspective of the character, is referred to as roleplaying. When a player speaks or describes action from the perspective of a character, it is referred to as being \u201cin character.\u201d Round In tactical combat, a round is a unit of time equal to 6 seconds in the game world; every character who is able to act gets a turn once per round. In starship combat, rounds consist of three phases of actions and don\u2019t correlate to a specific amount of time. Saving Throw A saving throw is a d20 roll representing your character\u2019s attempt to avoid or reduce some harmful effect. Tier Tier indicates scaling and is similar in meaning to \u201clevel\u201d; it is used for computers and starships, as well as other elements. Overview of Play Building a basic understanding of Starfinder gameplay will help you absorb the game\u2019s mechanical details. The following are common aspects of Starfinder play. Roleplaying Anytime you\u2019re speaking for your character or describing her actions but aren\u2019t in combat, you\u2019re roleplaying. This could be haggling with a trader, describing your plan to sneak into a research station, or just having a conversation with another player \u201cin character.\u201d These situations often require skill checks, in which a player rolls a 20-sided die and adds her modifier from the appropriate skill (see Chapter 5 for more about skills), special abilities. Sometimes roleplaying may progress into tactical combat. Game Masters should encourage players to be creative and resourceful during roleplaying, while also ensuring that their actions have consequences\u2014don\u2019t insult an excitable crime boss unless you\u2019re ready to defend yourself! Exploring Starfinder is primarily a space opera, and exploring and experiencing new worlds are key parts of the game. Exploration in Starfinder might involve a single space station, a new and alien planet, a faraway solar system, or the vast reaches of space. It might involve any aspect of roleplaying, but it always involves the GM describing the new and exciting scenes the PCs uncover and with which they can interact. Cultures, environments, and other wonders and hazards vary wildly when PCs explore new places. The setting material found in this module can help GMs describe the places the PCs venture, and the rules in Chapter 11 of the core-rulebook explain how to adjudicate the PCs\u2019 adventures in strange and hazardous places with regard to their statistics and abilities. Tactical Combat When the PCs confront or are accosted by a creature or character, the game shifts to tactical combat. Tactical combat involves characters moving around a tactical battle map, attacking or other special abilities, and defending themselves from their enemies. In Starfinder, attacking generally involves rolling a 20-sided die, adding modifiers to the result, and comparing the total to enemy statistics such as Armor Class to determine whether a target is hit. When their attacks hit, characters deal a variable amount of damage depending on their weapons and statistics. But of course, the enemy can do the same thing to them! Full details about Starfinder\u2019s tactical rules can be found in Chapter 8 of the core-rulebook. Starship Combat In combat between starships, the PCs pilot their ship around a starship battle map, trying to maneuver into the best position to fire on their enemies without being hit themselves. Full details about Starfinder\u2019s starship combat rules can be found in Chapter 9.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"overview/#overview","text":"","title":"Overview"},{"location":"overview/#what-is-in-this-module","text":"This module does not contain all the information that is required to play the Star Citizen Module of Starfinder.

Understanding how these devices work gives you insight into the world around you, allowing you to make the most of your gear, circumvent hardened defenses, and even take over remote systems. Your programming skill also gives you the ability to create a powerful ally, in the form of either an implanted artificial intelligence or a robotic drone, which can assist you with a variety of tasks.

Drones See Mechanic in the Core-Rulebook for more information Exocortex See Mechanic in the Core-Rulebook for more information Artificial Intelligence [Level: 1] You construct an artificial intelligence (or AI), a sophisticated program of self-motivated code that you can access for help in a variety of endeavors. This AI is the product of your own genius, far more advanced and complicated than any available for sale to consumers (though it falls short of being truly self-aware), and only you know the secrets of its creation and operation. Your AI can take one of two forms: a drone or an exocortex. You must pick one of these forms upon taking your first level of mechanic, and once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Drone You begin play with a powerful robotic drone to house your AI. You build and control this drone, which accompanies you on your adventures and is capable of combat, espionage, and other specialized tasks. As you gain levels, your drone advances in sophistication and gain additional abilities. While the value of your drone is immense, only you, with your extensive knowledge of its quirks and security measures, can ever hope to operate or repair it. Exocortex You begin play with an exocortex, an artificial processor that interacts with and augments your biological brain\u2019s cognitive functions, which can aid you in a variety of tasks, from combat to digital infiltration. Your exocortex is implanted within your physical body or brain, similar to a piece of cybernetic hardware, allowing your AI to access your mind and feed you information. As you gain levels, your exocortex advances in sophistication and processing power. Only you can access or interact with your exocortex. Bypass [Level: 1] You are skilled at getting inside computer systems and electronic devices. At 1st level, you gain a +1 insight bonus to Computers and Engineering skill checks. At 5th level, every 4 levels thereafter, and at 20th level, this bonus increases by 1. Custom Rig [Level: 1] You have created a customized toolkit you can use to hack systems and items. Your custom rig can be configured to take up an upgrade slot on your armor or can be installed as a cybernetic augmentation system in your brain (though it can be combined with a datajack for the same price as installing a datajack normally), your eyes, or an arm. For more information, see augmentations. Alternatively, you can configure it to be a handheld device, meaning that you must retrieve it and hold it to use it effectively. While using this rig, you always count as having the appropriate tool or basic kit for any Computers or Engineering skill check you attempt. Some mechanic tricks and drone mods require the use of a custom rig. In addition, you can use your custom rig as a Mk I comm unit. Finally, if you have a drone, you can use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your drone to issue commands to its AI or directly control it at a range of 2,500 feet. If your custom rig is damaged, destroyed, lost, or stolen, you can kitbash a new one from any engineering kit, hacking kit, or other technological toolkit, reconfiguring the materials into a new custom rig with 1 hour of work. You can have only one custom rig at a time. If you create a new custom rig, your old one functions as a normal toolkit of whatever type you made it from and can no longer be used with your mechanic tricks. Mechanic Trick [Level: 2] As you gain experience, you learn tricks that allow you to perform wonders of engineering, aid in electronic infiltrations, and optimize gear. While some of these are things you learn, others are small cybernetic enhancements you make to yourself (none of which have a price or count against your augmentation limits). Some tricks require the use of a custom rig or other gear. You learn your first mechanic trick at 2nd level, and you learn an additional mechanic trick at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter. If a mechanic trick allows an opponent a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier. If a mechanic trick requires an opponent to attempt a skill check, the DC is equal to 10 + 1-1/2 \u00d7 your class level + your Intelligence modifier. Unless otherwise specified, you can\u2019t learn mechanic tricks more than once. Overload [Level: 3] As a standard action, you can cause a short in an electronic device, including most ranged energy weapons, melee weapons with the powered special property, or a single armor upgrade. This makes the device nonfunctional for 1 round. Overload doesn\u2019t cause a locked door, safe, or other device to open, but it prevents anyone from opening it for 1 round. You must be adjacent to the device to use this ability. If you have a drone, you can instead use this ability on an electronic device adjacent to your drone. If you have an exocortex with the wireless hack ability, you can instead use this ability on any electronic device within range of your exocortex\u2019s wireless hack. If you use overload on an item or armor upgrade in someone\u2019s possession, the owner can attempt a Reflex saving throw to negate the effect (DC = 10 + half your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier). Overload doesn\u2019t affect androids, cybernetics, drones, powered armor, robots, or creatures with the technological subtype (all of which have shielding against this sort of attack), or items larger than Medium. Once a device has been successfully overloaded, a residual static charge prevents that device from being overloaded again for 1 minute. Weapon Specialization [Level: 3] You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type with which this class grants you proficiency. Remote Hack [Level: 5] You can use your custom rig to attempt Computers and Engineering skill checks at a range of 20 feet. At 7th level and every 2 levels thereafter, this range increases by 10 feet. A target of this ability (or a creature attending or observing your target) can attempt a Perception or Sense Motive check (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 \u00d7 your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier) to determine that you are the origin of this activity. Expert Rig [Level: 7] Your custom rig has improved. Whenever you use your custom rig to successfully hack into a computer, you can also disable one countermeasure installed in the system (except firewalls). In addition, your custom rig can now be used as any engineering or hacking specialty kit of item level 6th or lower, and it has the features of a computer with a tier equal to half your level with the artificial personality, hardened, or security I upgrade module. It also has an audio/video recorder. You can add extra modules or countermeasures to your custom rig at the normal prices. See page 213 for more information on computers. You can also use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your ship, allowing you to access your ship\u2019s downloaded data sets and transponder (see page 430) at a range of 5 miles. If you have a drone, you can issue commands to or directly control your drone at the same range. Miracle Worker [Level: 7] As a move action, you can repair damage to a starship\u2019s systems or modify a suit of armor or weapon to function more efficiently. To use this ability, you must be able to handle the item affected without impediment. You can use this ability once per day at 7th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 mechanic levels you have beyond 7th. The exact effect of this ability depends on the object or system you are modifying. Armor: You grant a +2 enhancement bonus to a suit of armor\u2019s EAC and KAC for 1 minute. Weapon: You grant a +2 enhancement bonus to a weapon\u2019s attack and damage rolls for 1 minute. Damaged Ship: You restore a number of Hull Points equal to the starship's base frame HP increment. If this raises the ship\u2019s HP over a multiple of its Critical Threshold, you can repair critical damage to one system per multiple, reducing its severity by one step. For example, if your starship\u2019s Critical Threshold is 8 and you restore 10 HP, reducing the damage to the hull from 17 HP to 7 HP, you could restore one system from wrecked to glitching. Using this ability during starship combat is your action for the turn, and you can do it only during the engineering phase. See page 292 for more on ship construction and page 320 for more on damage to ships. Override [Level: 9] Your overload class feature now affects androids, drones, robots, and creatures with the technological subtype, which must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier) or be dazed for 1 round. If the target fails its saving throw by 10 or more, it is not dazed and you can dictate its actions for 1 round, though these actions can\u2019t be obviously self-destructive. Once a creature has attempted a saving throw against this attack (regardless of the result), it is immune to this attack for 24 hours. Coordinated Assault [Level: 11] If you have a drone, whenever both you and your drone make attacks against the same target, you each receive a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack rolls. If you have an exocortex instead, whenever you and your exocortex are both attempting to hack a system, you each receive a +1 circumstance bonus to the checks to gain access. In either case, these bonuses increase to +2 at 17th level. Advanced Rig [Level: 13] Your custom rig\u2019s computer functions gain a bonus firewall countermeasure (see page 217). This firewall has no additional cost, does not count against the maximum number of countermeasures your custom rig can have, and can block off a module or group of modules already protected by a firewall. In addition, you can use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your ship, allowing you to access the ship\u2019s sensors, control its security systems, and prepare its engines for takeoff (as well as use the encrypted communications functions of your expert rig) at a range of 50 miles. If you have a drone, you can issue commands to or directly control your drone over an encrypted channel at the same range. Control Net [Level: 17] You are capable of operating multiple AIs, one in a drone and one in an exocortex. You must divide up your mechanic level between these different AIs, and each gains abilities based on the number of levels you assign to it. Every time you gain a level in mechanic, you can change the distribution of levels between these AIs using your custom rig after 24 hours of uninterrupted work. While each AI can act independently to the limits of its ability, you can control them as normal (although you can directly control only one AI at a time). If the number of levels assigned to your exocortex is less than your mechanic level, your exocortex grants a smaller increase to your base attack bonus when using combat tracking (see page 79), as noted in the table below. You gain additional exocortex abilities, such as wireless hack and multitasking, based upon the level you assign to it as normal. LEVELS ASSIGNED INCREASE TO BASE ATTACK BONUS 1-4 +1 5\u20138 +2 9-12 +3 13\u201316 +4 17\u201320 +5 Ghost in the Machine [Level: 19] When using your override class feature to affect an android, drone, robot, or creature with the technological subtype, a target that fails its saving throw by any amount is not dazed, and you can instead dictate its actions for the next round. These actions can\u2019t be obviously self-destructive. Once a creature has attempted a saving throw against this attack (regardless of the result), it is immune to this attack for 24 hours unless you spend 1 Resolve Point. You can continue to spend Resolve Points in this manner each round to make the creature susceptible to override again. Superior Rig [Level: 19] Your custom rig\u2019s computer functions now gain bonus lockout and wipe countermeasures. You can use your custom rig normally even when its lockout is active (you have special authorization no one else can access under any circumstances), and while any wiped data cannot be recovered by anyone else (as if the data module were destroyed), you can automatically recover it with 8 hours of work. These countermeasures have no additional cost and do not count against the maximum number of countermeasures your custom rig can have. Additionally, you can use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your ship at a range encompassing a planet and its close orbit, allowing you to remotely pilot your starship from point to point on the same planet or to and from orbit (as well as use the encrypted communications functions of your expert and advanced rig at the same range). If you have a drone, you can issue commands to or directly control your drone over an encrypted channel at the same range. Tech Master [Level: 20] You are a master of technology. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to craft any technological weapon, armor, or item at a rate of 1 minute per item level or spend 1 Resolve Point to convert any existing technological armor or weapon into another suit of armor or another weapon of equal or lesser value at a rate of 1 minute per item level. This uses the normal crafting rules presented on page 235, but the item being converted counts as its full value in crafting components. You cannot convert a one- handed weapon into a two-handed weapon. When converting an item into a cheaper item, any excess value is lost and cannot be reclaimed by converting the item back.","title":"Engineer"},{"location":"classes/engineer/#engineer","text":"You are a master of machines, from advanced supercomputers to simple magnetic engines.

Currency - UEC Shortly after the creation of the United Planets of Earth, Humanity\u2019s expansion into the galaxy was increasing at an exponential rate.

It was this rapid expansion and colonization that created the first real hurdle for the newly-formed UPE.

In the turmoil of multiple currencies a commission was formed and ultimately decided the entire currency system needed to be overhauled. Local governments were forbidden by the UPE from creating their own currencies andso they could bring all the various planets under on econsistent and unified form of currency.

The UPE also setup the Central Core Bank to create and administer the monetary policy, to conduct foreign exchange operations and monitor the banking sector. Most importantly, the Central Core Bank would maintain reserves to provide the financial backing that could honor the Credit attached to each UEC. It took several years for the UEC to take over as the official currency but when it did it also attracted the attention of the Banu Protectorate who were looking to solve a similar issue. Years later when UPE went through a title change to the United Empire of Earth (UEE) they UEC held true, although it now hold different names through out the 'verse.

Individual weapons are described in Weapon Descriptions. The descriptions are organized primarily by weapon category (cryo, flame, laser, plasma, projectile, shock, sonic, and uncategorized). Not all weapons and ammunition have all the entries listed here. Melee weapons and ammunition don\u2019t have range, shot, or rate of fire. Ammunition lists the number of cartridges or charges provided when purchased. Level: The weapon or ammunition\u2019s item level. Price: The typical market price of the weapon or ammunition. Damage: The amount of damage you roll when you hit with the weapon is listed here, along with an abbreviation for the damage type the weapon deals: A for acid, B for bludgeoning, C for cold, E for electricity, F for fire, P for piercing, S for slashing, and So for sonic. See Weapon Damage for more information. Range: The range increment of a ranged weapon. Critical: On a critical hit, a weapon\u2019s damage is rolled twice. This entry lists any additional effect the weapon has when you score a critical hit against a target. For more information about additional critical effects, see Critical Hit Effects. Capacity: A weapon\u2019s capacity measures the largest-capacity battery it can hold (given in number of charges), the number of rounds of ammunition its magazine can hold, the amount of fuel it carries, or the number of individual cartridges, grenades, or missiles it can hold. When a weapon entry states that its capacity is drawn, it means that you can hold only one such weapon in the number of hands required to use it. You can hold only a single grenade or shuriken in one hand, you can have only one arrow nocked at a time, and you can wield only one net at a time. Drawing a weapon\u2014such as grabbing a grenade from your belt\u2014requires a move action. Drawing a weapon might be different than wielding it. Usage: This listing shows how much ammunition is consumed with each attack you make with the weapon: The number of rounds from a magazine, the number of battery charges from a charged weapon, and so on. Bulk: This is the bulk of the item. Special: Any special properties of the weapon or ammunition are listed here (see Weapon Special Properties).","title":"Weapons"},{"location":"equipment/weapons/#weapons","text":"Weapon Damage types are denoted next to the damage Role and are as follows","title":"Weapons"},{"location":"equipment/weapons/#energy-damage","text":"Damange Type Symbol Description Acid A Damage dealt by corrosive substances and effects.

The woeful lack of communication between the various planet-states means that criminals can simply hop from world to world when his/her current world becomes too dangerous. Since the UEE (even the Advocacy) is forbidden to pursue criminals over the borders, the Banu Protectorate is a haven for UEE criminals. And if an attempt is made to reclaim fugitives through official channels, very few of the Banu planets will extradite any fugitives found on their surface. Political System The Banu Protectorate is a republic of Planet-States, each run under its own political system. The leaders (or selected representatives) of each planet will gather for a quorum to to discuss/debate legal and trade issues that affect the entire species. Otherwise, each is left to their own devices to succeed or fail. Relations Humans Friendly. Xi'an Friendly. Vanduul Precarious but friendly. This breaks down on a planet-by-planet basis, but generally the desire for money and trade outweighs loyalties and grudges.

It's no secret that Earth is set in its ways. All roads lead to Earth and the system is designed to support native-born Humans above all others. Tax policies support Earth-based corporations at the extreme disadvantage of those based on worlds like Terra, while representation in the UEE Senate continues to skew disproportionately in favor of Earth's populace. Put simply, Earth is the capital and namesake of the United Empire of Earth and it is the seat of power that governs everything from rising systems like Terra to distant colony worlds that barely impact the homeworlds' economies.

A particularly xenophobic hate-group known as Nemesis has been known to commit voter suppression against Tevarin.

Fearless: Vanduul receive a +2 racial bonus to saving throws against fear effects. Low-light Vision: Vanduul can see in dim light as if it were normal light. For more details, see page 264. A note about playing Vanduul Due to the many wars fought with the Vanduul if you are playing it in a primarily human setting you're setting yourself up for some very hard times. While you will definitely be an imposing force combatively you and your party will like suffer incredibly harsh prejudice particularly in UEE space. This is not to dissuade you from playing as a Vanduul character just a word of caution. Size and Type Xi'an are Medium humanoids Homeworld It is unknown if the Vanduul currently have a homeworld. Their homeplanet may have been destroyed or abandoned, which scattered the Vanduul clans into a nomadic lifestyle in their ships. On the other hand, it is unknown where young and female Vanduul live. Genetic analysis of X12' crew showed that all subjects had a diverse gene pool, which suggest that Hordes or Clans consist of not closely related individuals. It is possible that Clans and Hordes (which are only consisting of male individuals) are formed by a selection procedure on their homeworld and spend the rest of their life with their clan. Society and Alignment The political system of the Vanduul has been described as a meritocracy, the political philosophy in which power and wealth are given to the most talented members of a society. There is little to no communication between the different roaming clans. Each fleet operates as its own society with its own independent set of rules, laws and customs as decreed by that clan's Chieftain. As such, it is probably impossible to make peace or establish diplomatic relations with the Vanduul as a whole since there is no cohesive civilization. Vanduul do not hold permanent settlements and therefore do not claim land in their occupied systems. They eliminate every threat, raiding and pillaging the surface of an occupied planet with specialized Harvesters and then moving to a new location once the planet has been thoroughly drained of all resources. It seems that they are not interested in preserving their potential \"pasture grounds\", which could be a reason for their nomadic and expansionist lifestyle. Vanduul's family structure is also very distinct from Humanity. There is one tradition that exists throughout all of the Vanduul; once a child reaches adulthood (usually around the equivalent of Human 13\u201314 years), they are banished from their family. Before they go, the parents will fashion a knife for their child. This knife will be the child's only possession as he/she sets out into adulthood. Consequently, these knives are treasured possessions that they keep for the rest of their lives. They will receive no money, housing, or support of any kind from their former family. Everything that the newly recognized adult achieves starts with the knife and grows from there. Therefore, there is no hereditary transfer of money or influence. Religion Due to the cultural emphasis on solidarity, the idea of higher powers aiding or affecting an individual's life has never caught on with Vanduul society. Therefore, the 'self' is held in high regard, so the closest thing to a Vanduul religion is the admiration of a specific person and what he or she was able to achieve. Vanduul youth are educated in the lives of exemplary Vanduul of the past. Specifically the choices they made, and how they overcame their environment and distinguished themselves. Relations Banu Precarious but friendly Humans For unknown reasons, Vanduul don't communicate with humans. Xi'an There are a lot of unfriendly systems between the Vanduul and the Xi'an'. Some clans have trading relations to the Xi'an Empire Names and Language While Vanduul names are very gutteral and harsh sounding such as Thul'\u00d3qquray they are generally given common human nicknames and callsigns such as: Baron Von Dool, Blindside, Bloodhound, Deathwish, Double E, Leech, Little King, Payday, Reaper, Rook, The Priest","title":"Vanduul"},{"location":"races/vanduul/#vanduul","text":"The Vanduul (pronounced: / Van-DOOL /) are a race in Star Citizen.

Their homeplanet may have been destroyed or abandoned, which scattered the Vanduul clans into a nomadic lifestyle in their ships. On the other hand, it is unknown where young and female Vanduul live. Genetic analysis of X12' crew showed that all subjects had a diverse gene pool, which suggest that Hordes or Clans consist of not closely related individuals. It is possible that Clans and Hordes (which are only consisting of male individuals) are formed by a selection procedure on their homeworld and spend the rest of their life with their clan.","title":"Homeworld"},{"location":"races/vanduul/#society-and-alignment","text":"The political system of the Vanduul has been described as a meritocracy, the political philosophy in which power and wealth are given to the most talented members of a society. There is little to no communication between the different roaming clans. Each fleet operates as its own society with its own independent set of rules, laws and customs as decreed by that clan's Chieftain. As such, it is probably impossible to make peace or establish diplomatic relations with the Vanduul as a whole since there is no cohesive civilization. Vanduul do not hold permanent settlements and therefore do not claim land in their occupied systems. They eliminate every threat, raiding and pillaging the surface of an occupied planet with specialized Harvesters and then moving to a new location once the planet has been thoroughly drained of all resources. It seems that they are not interested in preserving their potential \"pasture grounds\", which could be a reason for their nomadic and expansionist lifestyle. Vanduul's family structure is also very distinct from Humanity. There is one tradition that exists throughout all of the Vanduul; once a child reaches adulthood (usually around the equivalent of Human 13\u201314 years), they are banished from their family. Before they go, the parents will fashion a knife for their child. This knife will be the child's only possession as he/she sets out into adulthood. Consequently, these knives are treasured possessions that they keep for the rest of their lives. They will receive no money, housing, or support of any kind from their former family. Everything that the newly recognized adult achieves starts with the knife and grows from there. Therefore, there is no hereditary transfer of money or influence.","title":"Society and Alignment"},{"location":"races/vanduul/#religion","text":"Due to the cultural emphasis on solidarity, the idea of higher powers aiding or affecting an individual's life has never caught on with Vanduul society. Therefore, the 'self' is held in high regard, so the closest thing to a Vanduul religion is the admiration of a specific person and what he or she was able to achieve. Vanduul youth are educated in the lives of exemplary Vanduul of the past.

The Xi'an present themselves as polite but neutral, particularly to those they have never met before. This is an age-old social testing mechanism.

The Xi'an pride themselves on having \u2018dignified\u2019 criminals, since acting from emotion is seen as a sign of weakness and immaturity.
