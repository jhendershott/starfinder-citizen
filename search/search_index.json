I highly encourage you to go and purchase the original core-rulebook from Paizo . What is different in the Starfinder Citizen module Starfinder is a sci-fi take on the original Pathfinder high fantasy tabletop rpg. As such Starfinder includes a lot of fantasy elements into the the system. While you could opt to use it, Star Citizen is a high tech level/0 magic level campain settings. As such All skills, feats, classes, and rules regarding magic will not apply and will not be included in this module and setting. However I would like to point a few things we're adding to help with your Star Citizen Immersion. First while Starfinder has a lot of rules for Combat we will be: 1. Adding rules and tables for Mining and Salvaging. 2. Adding damage and healing system more similar to Star Citizen 3. Adding in Death of a Spaceman Rules 4. Adding Star Citizen Lore specific factions 5. Creating a library of In-Game and Concept Ships and weapons so you can pilot the ship of your dreams even if it's not out Flight Ready yet. Another key factor goal of this project is to expand beyond the basic rules of Starfinder, mostly a well balanced space opera and move it more into a Sandbox style game. While you may have a GM that is well prepared with adventures for you, a lot of the fun of Star Citizen is the emergent gameplay. This is the type of feel and adventure that we want to grow here, Great Emergent Stories. The emergent stories created in a sandbox game are different. The GM does not have a single prearranged story on hand that he expects to fit the players into; he has many potential stories, for many potential places, all of them locales that the players may or may not visit. He might have a general idea of the goals that the players wish to accomplish, or offer them particular plot hooks to catch their interest and focus their efforts, but he largely sits back and facilitates the stories that the players grow themselves. Luckily we already have fleshed out systems, planets, stations and factiosn for you to move around in and we will be providing you with the the tools that you will need for quick generation tools for plot hooks, places of interest, and adventure frameworks ready for elaboration. Getting Started Once you have your hands on the core-rulebook you may want to dive directly into the rules and character creation beginning in Chapter 2, or you may want to dig into the Star Citizen Lore, some of which will contained in this module while the rest can be found at Roberts Space Industries . For players Making Characters, Chapter 2 of the Core-Rulebook will provide you a step-by-step walk-through of the process that includes references to the relevant chapters. However, different from the rulebook rather than viewing Chapter 3 with information about the different core races, please use the descriptions under that Races Tab in this module. Basic Starfinder Concepts 1d6, d20, etc. These figures are abbreviations for die rolls and indicate which dice you roll to determine a variable number, such as the amount of damage a weapon deals. The first number tells you how many dice to roll, while the second number tells you the number of sides the die or dice must have; if there\u2019s no first number, just roll one die. For example, \u201croll 2d8\u201d means that you must roll two eight-sided dice, and \u201croll a d20\u201d means you must roll one 20-sided die. Occasionally, you may need to roll a d3; if you don\u2019t have a three-sided die, you can roll a d6 instead\u2014treat a roll of 1 or 2 as a 1, a roll of 3 or 4 as a 2, and a roll of 5 or 6 as a 3. Abbreviations Starfinder has many game terms that are typically expressed as abbreviations, including HP (Hit Points), SP (Stamina Points), and RP (Resolve Points). If you miss or forget what an abbreviation means, they\u2019re explained in the glossary starting on page 512 (of the core-rulebook). Armor Class (AC) This is a number representing how hard it is for an enemy to strike your character in combat. A character has two Armor Classes: Energy Armor Class (EAC) and Kinetic Armor Class (KAC). Attack Roll An attack roll is a d20 roll that represents your character\u2019s attempt to strike another creature in combat. Check A check is a d20 roll that may or may not be modified by your character\u2019s statistics or another value. The most common types are skill checks and ability checks (which determine whether you successfully perform a task), and initiative checks (which determine when you act in combat). Combat Typically, references to combat refer to tactical combat between individual characters, which takes place on a square-gridded battle map and is covered in depth in Chapter 8. Combat can instead refer to starship combat, which uses a hex map; you can find the details of that system in Chapter 9. Creature A creature is an active participant in the story or world. This includes player characters (PCs), nonplayer characters (NPCs), and monsters. Difficulty Class (DC) This is the target number a creature must meet or exceed when attempting a check in order to accomplish a given task. Encounter An encounter is a situation that presents characters with a challenge. This could be a roleplaying challenge where they need to get information, a physical battle, a trap or puzzle, or anything else that requires players to use their wits or their characters\u2019 statistics. Characters typically earn experience points for completing encounters. Experience Points (XP) Often just called \u201cexperience,\u201d this is a way of tracking your character\u2019s increasing expertise gained as a result of overcoming challenges. When characters earn enough experience points, they advance in level, or \u201clevel up\u201d (see Leveling Up on page 26). Game Master (GM) The Game Master is the player who adjudicates the rules and controls the various elements of the Starfinder story and world that the players explore. A GM\u2019s duty is to provide a fair and fun game\u2014she wants the other players to ultimately succeed in their goals, but only after much heroic striving and danger. Hit Points (HP) and Stamina Points (SP) Stamina Points represent how much damage you can take before you\u2019re actually hurt, while Hit Points represent how badly hurt you can be before you fall unconscious or die. Stamina Points are lost before Hit Points and are much easier to regain. For a more detailed explanation, see page 22. Level A level is an indication of relative power within the game. There are several types of levels. Class level is the number of levels of a specific class that a character has. Character level is the sum of all of the levels a character has in all of her classes. Level can also refer to an item\u2019s level, or another scaling mechanic that falls within the framework of the game\u2019s rules. Modifier A modifier is a number that is added to a roll such as an attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. It can be positive or negative. Monster A monster is a nonplayer character. In general, monsters are too strange or unintelligent to be player characters, or are prevented from being them for other reasons. A monster might be a player character\u2019s opponent or ally, or serve any other role. Nonplayer Character (NPC) A nonplayer character is controlled by the GM for the purpose of interacting with players and helping advance the story. Player Character (PC) This is a character controlled by a player. Roleplaying Describing a character\u2019s actions, often while play-acting from the perspective of the character, is referred to as roleplaying. When a player speaks or describes action from the perspective of a character, it is referred to as being \u201cin character.\u201d Round In tactical combat, a round is a unit of time equal to 6 seconds in the game world; every character who is able to act gets a turn once per round. In starship combat, rounds consist of three phases of actions and don\u2019t correlate to a specific amount of time. Saving Throw A saving throw is a d20 roll representing your character\u2019s attempt to avoid or reduce some harmful effect. Tier Tier indicates scaling and is similar in meaning to \u201clevel\u201d; it is used for computers and starships, as well as other elements. Overview of Play Building a basic understanding of Starfinder gameplay will help you absorb the game\u2019s mechanical details. The following are common aspects of Starfinder play. Roleplaying Anytime you\u2019re speaking for your character or describing her actions but aren\u2019t in combat, you\u2019re roleplaying. This could be haggling with a trader, describing your plan to sneak into a research station, or just having a conversation with another player \u201cin character.\u201d These situations often require skill checks, in which a player rolls a 20-sided die and adds her modifier from the appropriate skill (see Chapter 5 for more about skills), special abilities. Sometimes roleplaying may progress into tactical combat. Game Masters should encourage players to be creative and resourceful during roleplaying, while also ensuring that their actions have consequences\u2014don\u2019t insult an excitable crime boss unless you\u2019re ready to defend yourself! Exploring Starfinder is primarily a space opera, and exploring and experiencing new worlds are key parts of the game. Exploration in Starfinder might involve a single space station, a new and alien planet, a faraway solar system, or the vast reaches of space. It might involve any aspect of roleplaying, but it always involves the GM describing the new and exciting scenes the PCs uncover and with which they can interact. Cultures, environments, and other wonders and hazards vary wildly when PCs explore new places. The setting material found in this module can help GMs describe the places the PCs venture, and the rules in Chapter 11 of the core-rulebook explain how to adjudicate the PCs\u2019 adventures in strange and hazardous places with regard to their statistics and abilities. Tactical Combat When the PCs confront or are accosted by a creature or character, the game shifts to tactical combat. Tactical combat involves characters moving around a tactical battle map, attacking or other special abilities, and defending themselves from their enemies. In Starfinder, attacking generally involves rolling a 20-sided die, adding modifiers to the result, and comparing the total to enemy statistics such as Armor Class to determine whether a target is hit. When their attacks hit, characters deal a variable amount of damage depending on their weapons and statistics. But of course, the enemy can do the same thing to them! Full details about Starfinder\u2019s tactical rules can be found in Chapter 8 of the core-rulebook. Starship Combat In combat between starships, the PCs pilot their ship around a starship battle map, trying to maneuver into the best position to fire on their enemies without being hit themselves. Full details about Starfinder\u2019s starship combat rules can be found in Chapter 9.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"overview/#overview","text":"","title":"Overview"},{"location":"overview/#what-is-in-this-module","text":"This module does not contain all the information that is required to play the Star Citizen Module of Starfinder.

Physical Description Humans have a wide range of inherited traits, such as body type, skin color, and facial features, yet these minor differences of heredity and genetics hold little significance in modern human society. Instead, humans\u2019 tendency to adapt to their environments means that more extreme differences, such as cybernetic augmentations, alien implants, and the elongated limbs of zero-g asteroid miners, are seen as far more important than ancient geography or skin color when defining modern ethnic groups.

It's no secret that Earth is set in its ways. All roads lead to Earth and the system is designed to support native-born Humans above all others. Tax policies support Earth-based corporations at the extreme disadvantage of those based on worlds like Terra, while representation in the UEE Senate continues to skew disproportionately in favor of Earth's populace. Put simply, Earth is the capital and namesake of the United Empire of Earth and it is the seat of power that governs everything from rising systems like Terra to distant colony worlds that barely impact the homeworlds' economies. Home to the Imperator and the UEE Senate, Earth sets the standards for everything that happens in the Empire, from moderating economic models, to setting social trends, to organizing military campaigns. While other more strategically located star systems, like Terra, have begun to make claims for higher standing in the Empire, Earth is still the acknowledged center of the universe. Contrarily, Earth wants for everything. Thousands of years of Human civilization have left many of the planet's natural resources exhausted and the system imports trillions upon trillions of tons of food, raw metals, manufactured goods and everything else imaginable.

As a result, humans cannot be said to lean toward any particular alignment\u2014though many aliens might argue that this marks them as chaotic.

Society and Alignment There is no official Tevarin government, as the race was destroyed to near extinction in its war with humanity and the survivors assimilated into the UEE. However, a few Tevarin have been given Citizenship to display the UEE's tolerance for xenos, but the total number of Tevarin Citizens might be measured in triple or even double digits.

Current Representation Regardless of having been assimilated into the UEE for more than 300 years, some human groups still hold grudges against the Tevarin. A particularly xenophobic hate-group known as Nemesis has been known to commit voter suppression against Tevarin. In one case, during the secondary votes of the 2950 UEE imperatorial Election, it was revealed that Nemesis would strategically deploy themselves near polling stations where high populations of Tevarin were known to live, intimidating them and denying them access. An example of a group that currently fights against this repression is the Tevarin advocacy group Stronger Together, founded in 2941. They routinely provide free legal representation for Tevarin who can't afford it and guide others through the complicated Citizenship application process. They monitor activity of anti-Tevarin hate groups and collate data of xenophobic crimes from all UEE systems. Religion Originally the Tevarin followed Rijora (/REE-jorr-ah/), a warrior-code similar to Bushid\u014d on ancient Earth. The Tevarin believed in honor, fealty, and duty above all else. Breaking this strict code meant excommunication, or even execution in extreme cases. After their defeat in the first war and the loss of their homeworld, the code began to decline in popularity. As a response to this, the Second Tevarin War was launched in an attempt to reclaim the Tevarin race's previous glory. However, this second war failed miserably. Consequently, when the last diehard believers of Rijora flung themselves toward Kaleeth, burning up in the atmosphere and crashing into the planet, the last chance for the Tevarin to reclaim their place in the galaxy had been lost. Following this final defeat the vast majority of surviving Tevarin abandoned their religion in a climatic period known as The Purge. Tragically, almost all Tevarin destroyed their Codices, which are the holy writs of Rijora. Relations Since the Tevarin are a vanishing race they are somewhat assimilated into the human society.

Fearless: Vanduul receive a +2 racial bonus to saving throws against fear effects. Low-light Vision: Vanduul can see in dim light as if it were normal light. For more details, see page 264. A note about playing Vanduul Due to the many wars fought with the Vanduul if you are playing it in a primarily human setting you're setting yourself up for some very hard times. While you will definitely be an imposing force combatively you and your party will like suffer incredibly harsh prejudice particularly in UEE space. This is not to dissuade you from playing as a Vanduul character just a word of caution. Size and Type Xi'an are Medium humanoids Homeworld It is unknown if the Vanduul currently have a homeworld. Their homeplanet may have been destroyed or abandoned, which scattered the Vanduul clans into a nomadic lifestyle in their ships. On the other hand, it is unknown where young and female Vanduul live. Genetic analysis of X12' crew showed that all subjects had a diverse gene pool, which suggest that Hordes or Clans consist of not closely related individuals. It is possible that Clans and Hordes (which are only consisting of male individuals) are formed by a selection procedure on their homeworld and spend the rest of their life with their clan. Society and Alignment The political system of the Vanduul has been described as a meritocracy, the political philosophy in which power and wealth are given to the most talented members of a society. There is little to no communication between the different roaming clans. Each fleet operates as its own society with its own independent set of rules, laws and customs as decreed by that clan's Chieftain. As such, it is probably impossible to make peace or establish diplomatic relations with the Vanduul as a whole since there is no cohesive civilization. Vanduul do not hold permanent settlements and therefore do not claim land in their occupied systems. They eliminate every threat, raiding and pillaging the surface of an occupied planet with specialized Harvesters and then moving to a new location once the planet has been thoroughly drained of all resources. It seems that they are not interested in preserving their potential \"pasture grounds\", which could be a reason for their nomadic and expansionist lifestyle. Vanduul's family structure is also very distinct from Humanity. There is one tradition that exists throughout all of the Vanduul; once a child reaches adulthood (usually around the equivalent of Human 13\u201314 years), they are banished from their family. Before they go, the parents will fashion a knife for their child. This knife will be the child's only possession as he/she sets out into adulthood. Consequently, these knives are treasured possessions that they keep for the rest of their lives. They will receive no money, housing, or support of any kind from their former family. Everything that the newly recognized adult achieves starts with the knife and grows from there. Therefore, there is no hereditary transfer of money or influence. Religion Due to the cultural emphasis on solidarity, the idea of higher powers aiding or affecting an individual's life has never caught on with Vanduul society. Therefore, the 'self' is held in high regard, so the closest thing to a Vanduul religion is the admiration of a specific person and what he or she was able to achieve. Vanduul youth are educated in the lives of exemplary Vanduul of the past. Specifically the choices they made, and how they overcame their environment and distinguished themselves. Relations Banu Precarious but friendly Humans For unknown reasons, Vanduul don't communicate with humans. Xi'an There are a lot of unfriendly systems between the Vanduul and the Xi'an'. Some clans have trading relations to the Xi'an Empire Names and Language While Vanduul names are very gutteral and harsh sounding such as Thul'\u00d3qquray they are generally given common human nicknames and callsigns such as: Baron Von Dool, Blindside, Bloodhound, Deathwish, Double E, Leech, Little King, Payday, Reaper, Rook, The Priest","title":"Vanduul"},{"location":"races/vanduul/#vanduul","text":"The Vanduul (pronounced: / Van-DOOL /) are a race in Star Citizen.

Vanduul do not hold permanent settlements and therefore do not claim land in their occupied systems. They eliminate every threat, raiding and pillaging the surface of an occupied planet with specialized Harvesters and then moving to a new location once the planet has been thoroughly drained of all resources. It seems that they are not interested in preserving their potential \"pasture grounds\", which could be a reason for their nomadic and expansionist lifestyle. Vanduul's family structure is also very distinct from Humanity. There is one tradition that exists throughout all of the Vanduul; once a child reaches adulthood (usually around the equivalent of Human 13\u201314 years), they are banished from their family. Before they go, the parents will fashion a knife for their child. This knife will be the child's only possession as he/she sets out into adulthood. Consequently, these knives are treasured possessions that they keep for the rest of their lives. They will receive no money, housing, or support of any kind from their former family. Everything that the newly recognized adult achieves starts with the knife and grows from there. Therefore, there is no hereditary transfer of money or influence.","title":"Society and Alignment"},{"location":"races/vanduul/#religion","text":"Due to the cultural emphasis on solidarity, the idea of higher powers aiding or affecting an individual's life has never caught on with Vanduul society. Therefore, the 'self' is held in high regard, so the closest thing to a Vanduul religion is the admiration of a specific person and what he or she was able to achieve. Vanduul youth are educated in the lives of exemplary Vanduul of the past. Specifically the choices they made, and how they overcame their environment and distinguished themselves.","title":"Religion"},{"location":"races/vanduul/#relations","text":"","title":"Relations"},{"location":"races/vanduul/#banu","text":"Precarious but friendly","title":"Banu"},{"location":"races/vanduul/#humans","text":"For unknown reasons, Vanduul don't communicate with humans.","title":"Humans"},{"location":"races/vanduul/#xian","text":"There are a lot of unfriendly systems between the Vanduul and the Xi'an'.

Society and Alignment To Humans, Xi'an culture can seem rigid and lifeless. A majority of that is artifice. The Xi'an present themselves as polite but neutral, particularly to those they have never met before. This is an age-old social testing mechanism. They approach a person as a blank-slate and let the other person set the tone (or tip his or her hand) as to how the interaction will progress.

The Xi'an pride themselves on having \u2018dignified\u2019 criminals, since acting from emotion is seen as a sign of weakness and immaturity. So criminals within the Xi\u2019an Empire are similar to the syndicates within the UEE, sprawling disciplined organizations whose business happens to be crime.

Each House is allowed by the Emperor to serve one function deemed vital to the mutual prosperity of the Xi\u2019an Empire.[12] Their system resembles a federal monarchy or the historical Chinese system of Fengjian.

They are known as Nyahuoa\u014dng Religion The state religion of the Xi'an is Li'tova, which is centered in the Kayfa system. Kayfa II is the seat of Li'tova, and humans believe that this is because the Kayfa II day is the same length as the Xi'an year.
