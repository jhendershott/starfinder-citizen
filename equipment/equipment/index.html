    <h1 id="equipment">Equipment</h1>
<p>The explored portions of the galaxy are expansive and dangerous. Everything from creatures, to roaming bandits to planetary sink holes that seem to appear out of nowhere swalling individuals and ships alike. As such you need to be prepared in all circumstance, whether that's a weapon to defend yourself, armor to protect you from the decompression of the vacuum of space or a slug launched from a ravager shotgun, and all the way to delicate computer systems to hack large servers. Either way you're going to need to be well stocked and you've come to the right place for it!</p>
<h2 id="currency-uec">Currency - UEC</h2>
<p>Shortly after the creation of the United Planets of Earth, Humanity’s expansion into the galaxy was increasing at an exponential rate. Terraforming technology became more accessible and new outfits began to spring up, sparking a planet rush for new terrain. It was this rapid expansion and colonization that created the first real hurdle for the newly-formed UPE. Various and competing forms of currencies had begun to appear on the various planets, challenging the Cash Transaction Records, or CTRs, the UPE’s official currency at the time.</p>
<p>In the turmoil of multiple currencies a commission was formed and ultimately decided the entire currency system needed to be overhauled. Local governments were forbidden by the UPE from creating their own currencies andso they could bring all the various planets under on econsistent and unified form of currency. This is how the <strong>United Earth Credit (UEC)</strong> was born. The UPE also setup the Central Core Bank to create and administer the monetary policy, to conduct foreign exchange operations and monitor the banking sector. Most importantly, the Central Core Bank would maintain reserves to provide the financial backing that could honor the Credit attached to each UEC.</p>
<p>It took several years for the UEC to take over as the official currency but when it did it also attracted the attention of the Banu Protectorate who were looking to solve a similar issue. Years later when UPE went through a title change to the United Empire of Earth (UEE) they UEC held true, although it now hold different names through out the 'verse. It could be refered to as <strong>United Earth Credit, UEC, Credits, or Imperials</strong>. All of these terms are acceptable when describing UEC.</p>
<h2 id="selling-equipment">Selling Equipment</h2>
<p>In general, you can sell equipment of any type anywhere you could the same equipment. However given that items come in a variety of conditions once they are used they can only be sold at a fraction of their value new. Selling used equipment in general, will only get you 10% of the value of a new piece of equipment of the same type.</p>
<h3 id="trade-goods">Trade Goods</h3>
<p>Trade goods are the exception since they are universal and more easily checked. These can be sold at 100% of the price, however they are subject to market fluctuations (See the table that hasn't been made yet)</p>
