    <h1 id="banu">Banu</h1>
<p>The Banu are an alien race and humanity's first interstellar friends. They are renowned for being focused on commerce and trading.</p>
<p><strong>Ability Adjustments:</strong> +2 Constitution, +2 Charisma, -2 Dexterity</p>
<p><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 4</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Resilience:</strong>Banu can survive in very high or very low temperatures. This allows them resistance to fire/heat and ice/cold damage and immunity to temperature and environment bases hazards</p>
<p><strong>Catnap:</strong>Banu don't need to sleep for long periods of time in fact typically they will take 10-15 minute naps while sitting or standing. If a banu is particularly exhausted it may sleep for up to 90 minutes but any long is considered unhealthy</p>
<p><strong>Culturally Inclined:</strong>Banu  are eager to learn about new cultures and societies. Shirrens receive a +2 racial bonus to Culture and Diplomacy checks.</p>
<h3 id="size-and-type">Size and Type</h3>
<p>Banu are Medium humanoids however they are generally around 7ft tall .</p>
<h3 id="homeworld">Homeworld</h3>
<p>The Banu homeworld is Bacchus II, an ocean planet with thousands of populated islands and archipelagos featuring a wide variety of climates and biodiversity. . At least the UEE thinks so because this is the world where the Banu convene for 'Gatherings',an event where Banu congregate to make species-wide decisions. A fact the Banu evade with aplomb. </p>
<h3 id="society-and-alignment">Society and Alignment</h3>
<p>The Banu are Humanity's first interstellar friends. Discovered by a NavJumper named Vernon Tar who was out exploring and nearly started a war by taking a shot at the Banu pilot. That Banu, as it turned out, was on the run from local officials for embezzling funds. Tar relayed his coordinates to the United Nations of Earth (UNE). A delegation party led by General Neal Socolovich was immediately dispatched to the system to undo any diplomatic fallout and open communication.[1] Once our two civilizations came together and signed the first Interstellar Peace &amp; Trade Accord, we began to trade technology and help each other expand into the universe. Once they spread out, they formed the Banu Protectorate to oversee all of their systems.</p>
<p>The Banu are the traders, the culture-hounds of the universe. Their planets are varied and colorful. Many tales of intrigue start in the murky back alleys of Banu cities.</p>
<h3 id="law-enforcement-and-crime">Law Enforcement and Crime</h3>
<p>Suffice it to say, there is a lot of crime in the Banu Protectorate. The woeful lack of communication between the various planet-states means that criminals can simply hop from world to world when his/her current world becomes too dangerous. Since the UEE (even the Advocacy) is forbidden to pursue criminals over the borders, the Banu Protectorate is a haven for UEE criminals. And if an attempt is made to reclaim fugitives through official channels, very few of the Banu planets will extradite any fugitives found on their surface.</p>
<h3 id="political-system">Political System</h3>
<p>The Banu Protectorate is a republic of Planet-States, each run under its own political system. The leaders (or selected representatives) of each planet will gather for a quorum to to discuss/debate legal and trade issues that affect the entire species. Otherwise, each is left to their own devices to succeed or fail.</p>
<h2 id="relations">Relations</h2>
<h3 id="humans">Humans</h3>
<p>Friendly.</p>
<h3 id="xian">Xi'an</h3>
<p>Friendly.</p>
<h3 id="vanduul">Vanduul</h3>
<p>Precarious but friendly. This breaks down on a planet-by-planet basis, but generally the desire for money and trade outweighs loyalties and grudges.</p>
<h2 id="names-and-language">Names and Language</h2>
<p>Banu is a glyphic languages similar to the Xi'an however they aren't as focused on pitch. Some examples of names are 
- Cothi Bat-Thel-Ma
- Mas Houlan</p>
