    <h1 id="vanduul">Vanduul</h1>
<p>The Vanduul (pronounced: / Van-DOOL /) are a race in Star Citizen. They are highly aggressive and appear to travel the galaxy in hordes, raiding colonies to survive. The Vanduul are the fourth alien race discovered by the United Empire of Earth, the first being the Banu.</p>
<p><strong>Ability Adjustments:</strong> +2 Strength, +2 Constitution, –2 Intelligence</p>
<p><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 6</p>
<p><strong>Vacuum Adept:</strong> Vanduul are capable of surviving an significant period of time in the vaccum of space without any protective gear. </p>
<p><strong>Natural Weapons:</strong>Vanduul are always considered armed. They can deal 1d3 lethal damage with unarmed strikes and the attack doesn’t count as archaic. Vanduul gain a unique weapon specialization with their natural weapons at 3rd level, allowing them to add 1–1/2 × their character level to their damage rolls for their natural weapons (instead of just adding their character level, as usual).</p>
<p><strong>Fearless:</strong> Vanduul receive a +2 racial bonus to saving throws against fear effects.</p>
<p><strong>Low-light Vision:</strong> Vanduul can see in dim light as if it were normal light. For more details, see page 264.</p>
<h2 id="a-note-about-playing-vanduul">A note about playing Vanduul</h2>
<p>Due to the many wars fought with the Vanduul if you are playing it in a primarily human setting you're setting yourself up for some very hard times. While you will definitely be an imposing force combatively you and your party will like suffer incredibly harsh prejudice particularly in UEE space. This is not to dissuade you from playing as a Vanduul character just a word of caution.</p>
<h2 id="size-and-type">Size and Type</h2>
<p>Xi'an are Medium humanoids</p>
<h2 id="homeworld">Homeworld</h2>
<p>It is unknown if the Vanduul currently have a homeworld. Their homeplanet may have been destroyed or abandoned, which scattered the Vanduul clans into a nomadic lifestyle in their ships. On the other hand, it is unknown where young and female Vanduul live. Genetic analysis of X12' crew showed that all subjects had a diverse gene pool, which suggest that Hordes or Clans consist of not closely related individuals. It is possible that Clans and Hordes (which are only consisting of male individuals) are formed by a selection procedure on their homeworld and spend the rest of their life with their clan.</p>
<h2 id="society-and-alignment">Society and Alignment</h2>
<p>The political system of the Vanduul has been described as a meritocracy, the political philosophy in which power and wealth are given to the most talented members of a society. There is little to no communication between the different roaming clans. Each fleet operates as its own society with its own independent set of rules, laws and customs as decreed by that clan's Chieftain. As such, it is probably impossible to make peace or establish diplomatic relations with the Vanduul as a whole since there is no cohesive civilization. </p>
<p>Vanduul do not hold permanent settlements and therefore do not claim land in their occupied systems. They eliminate every threat, raiding and pillaging the surface of an occupied planet with specialized Harvesters and then moving to a new location once the planet has been thoroughly drained of all resources. It seems that they are not interested in preserving their potential "pasture grounds", which could be a reason for their nomadic and expansionist lifestyle.</p>
<p>Vanduul's family structure is also very distinct from Humanity. There is one tradition that exists throughout all of the Vanduul; once a child reaches adulthood (usually around the equivalent of Human 13–14 years), they are banished from their family. Before they go, the parents will fashion a knife for their child. This knife will be the child's only possession as he/she sets out into adulthood. Consequently, these knives are treasured possessions that they keep for the rest of their lives. They will receive no money, housing, or support of any kind from their former family. Everything that the newly recognized adult achieves starts with the knife and grows from there. Therefore, there is no hereditary transfer of money or influence.</p>
<h3 id="religion">Religion</h3>
<p>Due to the cultural emphasis on solidarity, the idea of higher powers aiding or affecting an individual's life has never caught on with Vanduul society. Therefore, the 'self' is held in high regard, so the closest thing to a Vanduul religion is the admiration of a specific person and what he or she was able to achieve.</p>
<p>Vanduul youth are educated in the lives of exemplary Vanduul of the past. Specifically the choices they made, and how they overcame their environment and distinguished themselves.</p>
<h2 id="relations">Relations</h2>
<h3 id="banu">Banu</h3>
<p>Precarious but friendly</p>
<h3 id="humans">Humans</h3>
<p>For unknown reasons, Vanduul don't communicate with humans.</p>
<h3 id="xian">Xi'an</h3>
<p>There are a lot of unfriendly systems between the Vanduul and the Xi'an'. Some clans have trading relations to the Xi'an Empire</p>
<h2 id="names-and-language">Names and Language</h2>
<p>While Vanduul names are very gutteral and harsh sounding such as Thul'Óqquray they are generally given common human nicknames and callsigns such as: 
Baron Von Dool, Blindside, Bloodhound, Deathwish, Double E, Leech, Little King, Payday, Reaper, Rook, The Priest</p>
