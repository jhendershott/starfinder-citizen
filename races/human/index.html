    <h1 id="humans">Humans</h1>
<p>Ambitious, creative, and endlessly curious, humans have shown more drive to explore their system and the universe beyond than any of their neighbor races—for better and for worse. They’ve helped usher in a new era of system-wide communication and organization and are admired for their passion and tenacity, but their tendency to shoot first and think about the consequences later can make them a liability for those races otherwise inclined to work with them.</p>
<p><strong>Ability Adjustments:</strong> +2 to any 1 Ability</p>
<p><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 4</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Feat:</strong>Humans select one extra feat at 1st level.
<strong>Skilled</strong>Humans gain an additional skill rank at 1st level and each level thereafter.</p>
<h2 id="size-and-type">Size and Type</h2>
<p>Humans are Medium humanoids and have the human subtype.</p>
<h2 id="playing-a-human">Playing a Human</h2>
<p>You likely...</p>
<ul>
<li>See yourself as the hero of your own story, surely destined for some form of greatness.</li>
<li>Are innovative, flexible, and talented, and you pride yourself on your human resilience.</li>
<li>Get along well with members of other races and learn from other cultures and societies.</li>
<li>Hold passionate beliefs yet change your mind quickly when it’s in your interest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other races probably...
- See you as energetic and adaptable, but also as emotional, impetuous, and prone to violence.
- Pity you for the loss of your ancestral home world and worry that you covet theirs.
- See your self-confidence as arrogance.
- Respect your ability to get along with other races but view you as a dilettante with little culture of your own.</p>
<h2 id="physical-description">Physical Description</h2>
<p>Humans have a wide range of inherited traits, such as body type, skin color, and facial features, yet these minor differences of heredity and genetics hold little significance in modern human society. Instead, humans’ tendency to adapt to their environments means that more extreme differences, such as cybernetic augmentations, alien implants, and the elongated limbs of zero-g asteroid miners, are seen as far more important than ancient geography or skin color when defining modern ethnic groups. </p>
<h2 id="home-world">Home World</h2>
<p>This should be pretty familiar to youEarth (Sol III): cradle of Humanity, heart of the Empire, birthplace of mankind … and a difficult place to turn a profit. It's no secret that Earth is set in its ways. All roads lead to Earth and the system is designed to support native-born Humans above all others. Tax policies support Earth-based corporations at the extreme disadvantage of those based on worlds like Terra, while representation in the UEE Senate continues to skew disproportionately in favor of Earth's populace. Put simply, Earth is the capital and namesake of the United Empire of Earth and it is the seat of power that governs everything from rising systems like Terra to distant colony worlds that barely impact the homeworlds' economies. Home to the Imperator and the UEE Senate, Earth sets the standards for everything that happens in the Empire, from moderating economic models, to setting social trends, to organizing military campaigns. While other more strategically located star systems, like Terra, have begun to make claims for higher standing in the Empire, Earth is still the acknowledged center of the universe.</p>
<p>Contrarily, Earth wants for everything. Thousands of years of Human civilization have left many of the planet's natural resources exhausted and the system imports trillions upon trillions of tons of food, raw metals, manufactured goods and everything else imaginable. If it were not for the so-called "balance tariffs" keeping prices uncompetitive, this would be an ideal situation for any erstwhile shipping magnate. As it is, a run to Earth can barely be guaranteed to provide more than a 5% profit … and that's before you get to the exorbitant docking and refueling fees for spacecraft carrying other systems' registration numbers.</p>
<p>Earth is also safe, to an extreme. The UEE military, Advocacy and various police arms patrol the system ceaselessly and they are notoriously uncompromising when it comes to punishing wrongdoers in the system. There is no faster way to get an extremely high bounty on your head than to commit a crime, even a minor infraction, in space near Earth. The military dockyards in Earth orbit are home port to no less than five Bengal-class carriers and at least one is dry-docked at any given time.</p>
<p>The planet itself is pockmarked with starports, a natural evolution of nearly a millennium of Human space travel. Three of these have taken the throne as the significant import/export centers of the world: New York in North America, Moscow in Europe and Shanghai in Asia.</p>
<h2 id="society-and-alignment">Society and Alignment</h2>
<p>The diversity of human societies makes them both fascinating and frustrating to other races. Human settlements just a few miles apart may have wildly different governmental styles and social mores, and one faction may promote violent, xenophobic conquest while another wants only trade and friendship. If there’s anything that can be said about human society as a whole, it’s that it’s always in flux, with even the oldest cultures constantly adapting and reinventing themselves—a trait that often leads to humanity being seen as a “younger” race, regardless of the millennia it has existed. As a result, humans cannot be said to lean toward any particular alignment—though many aliens might argue that this marks them as chaotic.</p>
<h2 id="relations">Relations</h2>
<p>Humans are the glue that holds the rest of the solar system together. Their seemingly endless desire to explore and settle any habitable environment has positioned them perfectly to act as traders and mediators between other races, and their lack of their own planet often makes integrating into other cultures attractive to them. At the same time, not every race appreciates their viruslike spread. </p>
<h3 id="vanduul">Vanduul</h3>
<p>Since their first encounter in the Orion system, Humans and Vanduuls have been waging a merciless war. The UEE diplomats tried well to approach the clans, but nothing could calm this cultural war which does not seem to have an end.</p>
<h3 id="banu">Banu:</h3>
<p>The first race humanity encountered during its ascent to space, it has always kept a cordial understanding with humanity, and a peace agreement in principle exists. The Banus do a lot of business, and this is a more than sufficient vector of understanding for the UEE.</p>
<h3 id="xian">Xi'an</h3>
<p>The meeting with the Xi'An was the most tense period in the history of the UEE. Messerian totalitarianism weakened relations with the Xi'An from the first contact, triggering a long period of cold war leaving a constant doubt of open war. With the advent of the UEE and the fall of the Messers, this period came to an end for the more pleasant and peace-loving period we know today.</p>
<h3 id="tevarin">Tevarin</h3>
<p>There isn’t an official Tevarin civilization or government, as the race has almost been completely eradicated and its homeworld has been rendered uninhabitable for the Tevarin, effectively making them a dying race.</p>
<p>A few showcase Tevarin have been given Citizenship to display the UEE’s tolerance, but total Tevarin Citizens might be measured in triple (or even double) digits. The most notable of these showcase citizens is Suj Kossi, a UEE Navy veteran and Medal of Valor recipient who is currently running in the Jalan senatorial election.</p>
<h2 id="adventurers">Adventurers</h2>
<p>Ambition and desire for action are hallmarks of humanity, and countless humans leave home in search of wealth, fame, knowledge, excitement, or other means of bettering their situations. Since the discovery of the Quantum Travel and convenient interstellar travel, humans have led the charge in exploring and settling new worlds, driven by economic opportunity and ambition. Due to their versatility and adaptability, humans can fill any role in an adventuring party, from heavily armed soldier to charming envoy ambassador.</p>
<h2 id="names">Names</h2>
<p>Human names can be totally new inventions, local traditions, words borrowed from alien languages, or artifacts harkening back to cultures on vanished Golarion. Due to the absence of records from the Gap, it’s nearly impossible for individuals to trace their genealogy back to Golarion itself, and thus any names pulled from ancient history are claimed rather than true ethnic traditions. Some examples of human names are Akif, Alezandaru, Amare, Baolo, Belor, Darilian, Hadzi, Hai Minh, Hiriko, Iolana, Jokug, Korva, Morvius, Navasi, Pao, Pasara, Raziya, Revhi, Sahba, Sephia, Signe, Valki, and Yon.</p>
