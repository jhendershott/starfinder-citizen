    <h1 id="tevarin">Tevarin</h1>
<p>The Tevarin (/TEV-are-inn/) are an extraterrestrial species. After two wars with the United Planets of Earth (UPE) and their entire defeat in 2610, they lost their sovereignty and were absorbed into the UPE. The Tevarin homeworld was terraformed and annexed by the UPE.</p>
<p><strong>Ability Adjustments:</strong> +2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, –2 Charisma</p>
<p><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 4</p>
<p><strong>Keen Senses:</strong> The Tevarin avian ancestry grant them keen vision and hearing helping them to see and hear precisely, granting a +2 bonus to Perception checks.</p>
<p><strong>Efficient Sabotage:</strong> Once per day when attempting an Engineering check to disable a device, a Tevarin can roll 1d6 and add the result of the roll as an insight bonus to the check.</p>
<p><strong>Low Light Vision:</strong> All Tevarin can see in dim light as if it were normal light.</p>
<h2 id="size-and-type">Size and Type</h2>
<p>Tevarin are Medium humanoids</p>
<h2 id="homeworld">Homeworld</h2>
<p>Formerly known as Kaleeth, it has since been terraformed, colonized by Humans, and renamed to Elysium IV. In 2946, Suj Kossi, a UEE veteran, was the planet's first senator to come from the Tevarin population.</p>
<h2 id="society-and-alignment">Society and Alignment</h2>
<p>There is no official Tevarin government, as the race was destroyed to near extinction in its war with humanity and the survivors assimilated into the UEE. However, a few Tevarin have been given Citizenship to display the UEE's tolerance for xenos, but the total number of Tevarin Citizens might be measured in triple or even double digits. Most other Tevarin lack any political affiliation to a party, generally ignoring the human-centric politics of the UEE with a sort of bland apathy.</p>
<h3 id="current-representation">Current Representation</h3>
<p>Regardless of having been assimilated into the UEE for more than 300 years, some human groups still hold grudges against the Tevarin. A particularly xenophobic hate-group known as Nemesis has been known to commit voter suppression against Tevarin. In one case, during the secondary votes of the 2950 UEE imperatorial Election, it was revealed that Nemesis would strategically deploy themselves near polling stations where high populations of Tevarin were known to live, intimidating them and denying them access.</p>
<p>An example of a group that currently fights against this repression is the Tevarin advocacy group Stronger Together, founded in 2941. They routinely provide free legal representation for Tevarin who can't afford it and guide others through the complicated Citizenship application process. They monitor activity of anti-Tevarin hate groups and collate data of xenophobic crimes from all UEE systems.</p>
<h3 id="religion">Religion</h3>
<p>Originally the Tevarin followed Rijora (/REE-jorr-ah/), a warrior-code similar to Bushidō on ancient Earth. The Tevarin believed in honor, fealty, and duty above all else. Breaking this strict code meant excommunication, or even execution in extreme cases.</p>
<p>After their defeat in the first war and the loss of their homeworld, the code began to decline in popularity. As a response to this, the Second Tevarin War was launched in an attempt to reclaim the Tevarin race's previous glory. However, this second war failed miserably. Consequently, when the last diehard believers of Rijora flung themselves toward Kaleeth, burning up in the atmosphere and crashing into the planet, the last chance for the Tevarin to reclaim their place in the galaxy had been lost. Following this final defeat the vast majority of surviving Tevarin abandoned their religion in a climatic period known as The Purge. Tragically, almost all Tevarin destroyed their Codices, which are the holy writs of Rijora.</p>
<h2 id="relations">Relations</h2>
<p>Since the Tevarin are a vanishing race they are somewhat assimilated into the human society. In the present day there is an anger and deep sadness to be found in most Tevarin. Their people are diminished and scattered, and the loss of their religion, their culture, and their homeworld has had a profound psychological effect on their race. Truly, theirs is the melancholy of a broken, declining people.</p>
<p>After the second war, many Tevarin channeled their aggressive natures into addictions and violence. Indeed, Tevarin mercenaries are noted for their ruthlessness and utter lack of fear. However, the average Tevarin finds little joy in life. Most humans find Tevarin to be terse and cynical and this sentiment is seen towards all races.</p>
<h2 id="names">Names</h2>
<p>Examples of Tevarin names are as follows: Corath'Thal, Nescus, Suj Kossi</p>
