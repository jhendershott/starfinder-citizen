    <h1 id="salvage">Salvage</h1>
<p>Salvage can either be an activity or a full fledged career. Salvage is the act of gathering everything from Components, weapons, and resources such as Water, Oxygen and Fuel from a derelict ship, all the way to breaking down those ships into scrap metal. Once these have been collected they can be sold to make money, used to repair upgrade and outfit your own ships</p>
<h2 id="finding-salvage">Finding Salvage</h2>
<p>There are a couple of ways to find ships to salvage, some legitimate, some less so. </p>
<p>Your first method is to use terminals and job boards to find salvage claims. A Salvage Claim is when someone has reported a derelict vessel..for one reason or another. That has gone through the proper channel and a crew it a Salvage License can take the claim and proceed to the location and salvage the vessel. In this case the crew that has accepted the claim has full rights to everything on board that vessel. </p>
<p>Another method which is looked down upon, is stumbling across a distress signal, or through deep space scanners and finding a derelict vessel. This would be considered illegitimate salvage. However, This isn't necessarily illegal. If you security happens to come across your crew while you are salvaging the derelict, you must collect and present the flight recorder to security to prove you were not to blame for the current state of the ship and crew you are salvaging. </p>
<p>In the instance of Illegitimate Salvage, if you are in the process of salvaging the vessel and a crew arrives with a legitimate Salvage claim, all of the components and materials of said vessel belong to the crew with the claim and should be forfeited by the initial crew unless some other agreement can be struck</p>
<p>In any case, if you arrive at a vessel that is not functioning the highest priority is to provide aid to the crew if they are still alive and in need. Unfortunately most of the time this isn't the case, if you find perished crew on board, this information needs to be logged and provided to the authorities as soon as possible, and proper treatment of the deceased crew should be observered and the bodies recovered if possible. Similarly you can use long range communication to identify the bodies which can be collected and properly cared for by a dedicated crew.</p>
<p>Your final way to locate salvage is to...provide that salvage yourself. In the case of space combat, whether in defense or otherwise, once a ship has been disabled and the crew can no longer man the vessel, then you can begin salvage. However, attacking another ship, especially without provocation or the crew does not have an open bounty, is punishable by force in most systems. If you are approached by security, and are unable to provide the flight recorder OR the flight recorder shows a recent battle and communication without report then it will be assumed that your crew committed heinous crimes against the crew of this vessel and you are subject to seizure and imprisonment.</p>
