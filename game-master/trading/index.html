    <h1 id="trading">Trading</h1>
<p>Trading can either be a career choice for chartacters or just a way to make a little money on the side when travelling around the system, whether you've loaded a small haul into your RSI aurora or you've loaded down dedicated cargo haulers like the Argo Raft or Drake Caterpillar, with a little bit of investment capital you can make it rich...or fall prey to pirates...who knows</p>
<h2 id="purchasing-goods">Purchasing Goods</h2>
<p>The first step in trading is determining the available goods. If you know the Goods you're after you can find them on the Trade Goods By Type Table Below. Otherwise you can determine your location type under Settings and Lore/Stanton then look at the Location by Buy Type Table below. </p>
<p>Next you need to determine the amount of said material is avaiable. Since you can fill ships of many sizes from a single SCU in an Aurora to thousands of SCU in a Hull E you will roll <strong>1d20x1d10</strong> for each type you want to purchase. The Exception is the amount of VICE goods you want to trade which will be <strong>1d10 x 1d4.</strong> However, BE AWARE, if you get scanned by security while you have this on board then you can be subject to goods seizure as well as jail time.</p>
<p>Finally you must determine the Purchase Price. In the tables below you will see a Base Buy Price. This the price that these goods start from and can go up or down depending on the availability and the parties ability to haggle with the merchant. First you will determine the availability by Rolling a <strong>1d20</strong>. 
- 1 Means there is none of that material available
- 2-6 means low stock is present and the price is raised by 20%
- 7-15 means that a normal amount is present start at base price
- 16-20 means there is a surpluse and price is lowered by 20%</p>
<p>If you've got a smooth talker in your party then you can barter with the clerk at the sales desk use a <strong>DC 15 Diplomacy, Intimidate or Bluff Check</strong>. For every point over a success you will get <strong>1d4%</strong>off the purchase price. Example if you roll a Diplomacy of 19 you will get <strong>4d4%</strong> off the the Base Buy Price up to a maximum of 25%. Alternatively, if you make a very persuasive argument your GM can bypass the role and give you the discount. </p>
<h2 id="selling-goods">Selling Goods</h2>
<p>Once you've loaded up with Cargo you will follow a very similar process with reversed Values. You will first determine the purchasing power that the location has <strong>1d20x1d10</strong> for each type you want to sell. The Exception is the amount of VICE goods you want to trade which will be <strong>1d10 x 1d4.</strong> A successful DC 15 Diplomacy, Bluff or Intimidation check could increase the amount a location is willing to purchase. In this case you can roll and additional 1d6, making the total, <strong>1d20+1d6 x 1d10</strong></p>
<p>Then determine the need for a given product by Rolling a <strong>1d20</strong>. 
- 1 means they are unwilling to purchase any of this good type
- 2-6 means there is a surplus and price is lowered by 20%
- 7-15 means that a normal amount is present start at base price
- 16-20 means there is a surplus and price is raised by 20%</p>
<p>As well as increasing the price of the goods you're selling with a successful<strong>DC 15 Diplomacy, Intimidate or Bluff Check</strong>. For every point over a success you will get <strong>1d4%</strong>off the purchase price. Example if you roll a Diplomacy of 19 you will get <strong>4d4%</strong> off the the Base Buy Price up to a maximum of 25%.</p>
