# The Stanton System

The Stanton system is a single star system, and one of only two fully colonized systems in the UEE. It is the only system with a green zone reaching four planets, making it suitable for human life. All worlds have undergone limited terraforming and have flora and fauna with divergent ecologies. They are also corporate-owned while belonging to the United Empire of Earth.
