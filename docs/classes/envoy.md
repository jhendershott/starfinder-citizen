# Envoy
Merchants, entrepreneurs, actors, amdassadors, politicians, con artists, ship captains. All of the them have great charisma, the capacity to ispire, terrorize or deceive others, and a deep knowledge of people, their culture and their traditions.

Skilled manipulators and tacticians, where others succeed using weapons, they excel using only their words.

Playing an Envoy means being the tactician and the smooth talker of the group. A skilled envoy can remove himself and his party from almost danger without firing a single shot.

### Differences with Starfinder
Envoys in Starfinder are a bit of a do-it-all. They're good at social situations, but excel in fighting and technical feats too.   
In SC:RG Envoys are really good in every discipline that requires smooth-talking, but less adept in other fields.
