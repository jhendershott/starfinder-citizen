## What is Starfinder Citizen
Starfinder-citizen is a labor of love from the Star Citizen community wanting an extra level of roleplay for a game they passionately support. Based on the Paizo Publishing game Starfinder we're giving you the tools you need to take your tabletop rpg into the 'verse staring with the Stanton System and beyond

### Credit where Credit is due
Since we couldn't actually make this happen without the original IP of two amazing companies and games I highly encourage you to spend the time and money supporting those projects. As such we're only going to include the Starfinder Citizen specific information here, everything else will be found in the systems.
