Trading can either be a career choice for chartacters or just a way to make a little money on the side when travelling around the system, whether you've loaded a small haul into your RSI aurora or you've loaded down dedicated cargo haulers like the Argo Raft or Drake Caterpillar, with a little bit of investment capital you can make it rich...or fall prey to pirates...who knows
