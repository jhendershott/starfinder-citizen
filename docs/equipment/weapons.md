## Reading Weapon Tables
An entry on a weapon table describes a single weapon, with the following statistics. Individual weapons are described in Weapon Descriptions. The descriptions are organized primarily by weapon category (cryo, flame, laser, plasma, projectile, shock, sonic, and uncategorized).

Not all weapons and ammunition have all the entries listed here. Melee weapons and ammunition don’t have range, shot, or rate of fire. Ammunition lists the number of cartridges or charges provided when purchased.

- Level: The weapon or ammunition’s item level.

- Price: The typical market price of the weapon or ammunition.

- Damage: The amount of damage you roll when you hit with the weapon is listed here, along with an abbreviation for the damage type the weapon deals: A for acid, B for bludgeoning, C for cold, E for electricity, F for fire, P for piercing, S for slashing, and So for sonic. See Weapon Damage for more information.

- Range: The range increment of a ranged weapon.

- Critical: On a critical hit, a weapon’s damage is rolled twice. This entry lists any additional effect the weapon has when you score a critical hit against a target. For more information about additional critical effects, see Critical Hit Effects.

- Capacity: A weapon’s capacity measures the largest-capacity battery it can hold (given in number of charges), the number of rounds of ammunition its magazine can hold, the amount of fuel it carries, or the number of individual cartridges, grenades, or missiles it can hold. When a weapon entry states that its capacity is drawn, it means that you can hold only one such weapon in the number of hands required to use it. You can hold only a single grenade or shuriken in one hand, you can have only one arrow nocked at a time, and you can wield only one net at a time. Drawing a weapon—such as grabbing a grenade from your belt—requires a move action. Drawing a weapon might be different than wielding it.

- Usage: This listing shows how much ammunition is consumed with each attack you make with the weapon: The number of rounds from a magazine, the number of battery charges from a charged weapon, and so on.

- Bulk: This is the bulk of the item.

- Special: Any special properties of the weapon or ammunition are listed here (see Weapon Special Properties).
